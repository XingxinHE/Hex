- #TODO 
	- 9.7 & 9.8 I have read front and back. Require documentation. This is a good reference of designing interface. Possible to integrate to future chapter 14(design class)?
- #thingsIDK
	- p456, "use Shape's constructors(A.16)"
- #unorganized
	- Beware that compilers often have a "debug mode" where they by default features to ship a program, when running an optimizer, or simply when compiling on a different machine, a program with uninitialized variables may suddenly run differently. Don't get caught with an uninitialized variable.
