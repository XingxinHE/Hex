# 📖Chapter 2 Solving Linear Equations $Ax=b$

**👑Importance**
$Ax=b$ is a universal problem in science and engineering and every quantitative subject.

The elimination steps are: $A$    to    $EA=U$    to    $A=E^{-1}U$    to    $LU$
If the steps fail, this signals that $Ax=b$ has no solutions.

The key matrices in this chapter are:

## 2.1 The Idea of Elimination
- 📌understand what is so-called [[system of linear equations#📝Definition]]
  - because it is mentioned so many times in so many books!

- 📌understand the solution of a linear system
	- [[system of linear equations#🌈Properties#🔴Solution set]].

- 📌why upper triangular matrix is useful
  - [[upper triangular matrix#🚀Benefit / Pros#🛰️easy to solve system of linear equations]]

- 📌full rank square matrix can deduced to upper triangular matrix
  - [[upper triangular matrix#🚿Source]]


- 📌quick review what is elimination
