# 📖Chapter 1 Vectors and Matrices
## 1.1 Linear Combinations of Vectors
- key takeaway: the column and row picture of vector and matrix, how linear combination spans the space
- [[linear combination]], [[vector]], [[matrix]]
## 1.2 Lengths and Angles from Dot Product
- key takeaway: understand the dot product and how it measure the angles
- [[Inner Product|dot product]], [[Inner Product#^d19bad21ef5d7eb7|Angle]], [[Triangle Inequality]], [[Schwarz Inequality]]
## 1.3 Matrices and Column Spaces
- key takeaway:
- [[matrix rank]], [[column space]]
#thingsIDK p23-p24
#TODO  p27-p28 problem sets

- 📌why rank is so important
	- [[matrix rank#👑Importance]]
- 📌an important fact
  - [[matrix rank#🌈Properties#🔴Row Rank = Column Rank]]
- 📌column space and linear equation
  - [[column space#🌱Related Elements#🥑column space vs. linear equation]]


## 1.4 Matrix Multiplication and $A=CR$
### matrix multiplication
- 📌Definition
  - [[matrix multiplication#📝Definition]]
- 📌Intuition
	- [[matrix multiplication#🧠Intuition]]
- 📌Example
	- [[matrix multiplication#🗃Example]]
- 📌a special type of matrix multiplication $CR=A$
	- see what is here [[matrix multiplication#🏷Categories#🔖$CR=A$]]

### matrix with dependent columns
- 📌only 1 column independent - [[rank one matrix]]
	- see the definition [[rank one matrix#📝Definition]]
	- see the intuition [[rank one matrix#🧠Intuition]]
	- one major stuff is to understand the row space and column space of a rank one matrix [[rank one matrix#⛈Characteristics#☁column space and row space]]
- 📌One super important reverse engineering $A=CR$⭐
	- see here [[matrix multiplication#🌱Related Elements#🍌Reverse matrix multiplication to $A=CR$]]

#TODO  p35-p37 problem sets


# 📖Chapter 2 Solving Linear Equations $Ax=b$

**👑Importance**
$Ax=b$ is a universal problem in science and engineering and every quantitative subject.

The elimination steps are: $A$    to    $EA=U$    to    $A=E^{-1}U$    to    $LU$
If the steps fail, this signals that $Ax=b$ has no solutions.

The key matrices in this chapter are:

## 2.1 The Idea of Elimination
- 📌understand what is so-called [[system of linear equations#📝Definition]]
  - because it is mentioned so many times in so many books!
- 📌understand the solution of a linear system
	- [[system of linear equations#🌈Properties#🔴Solution set]].
