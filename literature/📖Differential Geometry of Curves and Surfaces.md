# 📖Chapter 1 Curves
https://people.math.wisc.edu/~jwrobbin/Do_Carmo/curves_do_carmo.pdf

## 1-1 Introduction


- 📌What is the difference between classic and global, differential geometry?
  - [[differential geometry#🧪Composition#🧫classical differential geometry]]
  - [[differential geometry#🧪Composition#⚗global differential geometry]]

- 📌the curve in calculus context
  - see [[📖Thomas’ Calculus#📖Chapter 13 Vector-Valued Functions and Motion in Space#13.1 Curves in Space and Their Tangents]]


## 1-2 Parametrized Curves
**🔭subjects covering**:
- [[smooth curve|differentiable curve]]

- 📌what kinds of properties a curve has?
  - [[smooth curve#🌈Properties]]

- 📌what is [[singularity|singular point]]?
  - see [[smooth curve#^665e91]]

- 📌what is a planar curve?
	- [[plane curve]]

## 1-3 Regular Curves; Arc Length
- 📌what is a "regular" curve?
  - [[smooth curve#⛈Characteristics#☁regular]]

- 📌how to describe 2 identical curves but "flip" with direction?
  - [[smooth curve#⛈Characteristics#🌧change of orientation]]

- 📌a special kind of curve
  - [[smooth curve#🏷Categories#🔖special kind of curve]]
  - Why is special? Since the $t$ is already the arc length!

## 1-4 The Vector Product in $\mathbb{R}^3$
## 1-5 The Local Theory of Curves Parametrized by Arc Length
## 1-6 The Local Canonical Form
## 1-7 Global Properties of Plane Curves
