# 📺Lectures
## Lecture 1
- [[vector]]
## Lecture 7✅
- [[Linear Function]]
- [[Affine Function]]
## Lecture 8✅
- [[Taylor Approximation]]
- [[Regression Model]]
## Lecture 9
- [[Norm]]
- [[L2-norm]]. In this course, they refer "norm" as L-2 norm.
## Lecture 10✅
- Euclidean distance, triangle inequality, feature distance, document dissimilarity. Written in the operation section in vector.
## Lecture 15✅
- ⭐⭐[[Linear Dependence]], [[Linear Independence]]
- Boyd said these are super important concept across his book.
- [[basis]], [[Orthonormality]]
## Lecture 17✅
- [[matrix]]
- TODO currently, the norm is kind of messy in [[matrix]], [[vector]], [[Norm]], and [[L2-norm]]. Try to organize them in light of more general and bigger picture. e.g. L-$p$ norm (see wolfram mathworld)
## Lecture 18✅
- Matrix-Vector Multiplication
## Lecture 19✅
- Matrix-vector operation applicability
