# 📝Summary
**🎯Intent**
- algorithm - to know what it is first
- correctness - then to define what is correct
- efficiency - evaluate the efficiency
- model of computation - how to compute and integrate algorithm in computation
- data structure - how data structure can help
- runtime analysis - having all set up, it's time to analyze
