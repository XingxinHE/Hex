# 💭Things I don't Know

# 🍂Unorganized

If the **objective function** in the optimization problem and the **feasible region** are **both convex**, then **any local solution** of the problem **is** in fact a **global solution**.

### Non-smooth Problem
- ![name|300](../assets/non_smooth_problem.png)
- 📝Definition
	- Geometrically, the nonsmooth function consists of a few smooth pieces, with **discontinuities between the pieces**.
- 🎯Intent
	- It may be possible to find the minimizer by **minimizing each smooth piece individually**, a.k.a. examing the **subgradient** and **generalized gradient**.
	- (a side note, this book will not cover non-smooth problem.)
