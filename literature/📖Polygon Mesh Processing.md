## 1.4 Implicit Surface Representations
Review the definition at here![[implicit surface representation#📝Definition]]

Preceding is just a description of an implicit surface. So what is its equation? ![[implicit surface representation#✒Notation]]

Understand the objective of it.![[implicit surface representation#🎯Intent]]

Take a look at the example ![[implicit surface representation#🗃Example]]

Be aware of the characteristics of it. ![[implicit surface representation#⛈Characteristics]]
The value of the function $F$ has special meaning.
![[implicit surface representation#💫Operation]]

The preceding neat operation help implicit surface in its applicabilites.
![[implicit surface representation#🧀Applicability#🍞 constructive solid geometry]]

In the meantime, we must be also aware of its cons. ![[implicit surface representation#🩹Cons]]

The appropriate data structures for implicit surface. ![[implicit surface representation#🎶 Data Structures]]
