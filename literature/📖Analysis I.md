# 📖1 Introduction
## 1.1. What is analysis?
## 1.2. Why do analysis?

# 📖2 Starting at the beginning: the natural numbers
- 📌Knowing how to use sth $\neq$ knowing how to define sth
  - How to use the natural numbers, which is something you of course know how to do very well. It’s like the difference between knowing how to use, say, a computer, versus knowing how to build that computer.

## 2.1. The Peano axioms
**🔭subjects covering**:
- [[natural number]]
- [[Peano's Axioms]]

- 📌the operation related to natural number
  - we will only talk about [[increment operation|increment]] in this chapter, [[subtraction]] and [[division]] are not well-suited for natural number. 
- 📌Why no [[addition]] and [[multiplication]]?
	- since they are merely the "advanced" version of increment.

- 📌difference of increment between math and cs
  - [[increment operation#📝Definition]]

- 📌understand Peano axioms in Socratic way
  - [[Peano's Axioms#🗿Socratic Method]]

- 📌How mathematics work
	- In the [[natural number#📝Definition]], the natural number is defined by proof. This is how mathematics works - it treats its objects abstractly, caring only about what properties the objects have, not what the objects are or what they mean.

- 🧾The terminology I learned in this section
  - [[successor]], [[proposition]], [[priori]], [[posteriori]], [[modulo]], [[modulus]], [[isomorphic]], [[congruence]], [[axiom]], [[Principle of Strong Induction]], [[Principle of Weak Induction]], [[Principle of Mathematical Induction]], [[nonisomorphic]], [[lemma]], [[theorem]], [[porism]], [[postulate]], [[proof]], [[Q.E.D.]]

## 2.2. Addition
## 2.3. Multiplication

# 📖3 Set theory
## 3.1. Fundamentals
## 3.2. Russell’s paradox (Optional)
## 3.3. Functions
## 3.4. Images and inverse images
## 3.5 Cartesian products
## 3.6 Cardinality of sets

# 📖4 Integers and rationals
## 4.1 The integers
## 4.2 The rationals
## 4.3 Absolute value and exponentiation
## 4.4 Gaps in the rational numbers
