- No more than Heading 3!! Because that's not atomic.
- Don't create meaningless linking since it will create a lot of redundance.
- Limit the pages as much as possible. Only create pages when it oversizes current subject.

# Structure of a Note
Why should we need this?
- writing and organizing such input can formalize our ideas.
- a subject with patterns is powerful. e.g. analogy to design patterns.

定义

🧠Intuition
Find an intuitive way of understanding this concept.

🌓Complement
What is the complement of this subject? e.g. vector-covector, constructor-destructor. 这里讲的是一种正负对应的关系


🗃Example
Example is the most straightforward way to understand a concept. Therefore, it has to be **compact**!

💫Operation
e.g. plane和plane之间的intersection就在operation而不在properties和characteristic

🌈Properties
⛈Characteristics
These 2 are super close and I used to use them interchangebly. I would like to put it this way. 
- "Properties" is something already configured in something. 实的，属性，一个东西的属性。
- "Chracteristics" is something vague. 虚的，描述性的，概括性的



⌨Sample Code
这里指的是

🕹Quiz
Quiz一般是数学题，很长。example放不下的放这里

🗿Socratic Method
这是我全新的尝试，采用苏格拉底式的提问来更好地理解某些问题。这里和quiz的区别，quiz是讲究完整得做完一道题，但是苏格拉底式提问是为了追求问题本质。

> [!note]
> This is also very useful when you are trying to refer some nots. e.g. When I see some "🔴xxx" and I can refer to "🌈" which is the property.


# Literature vs. Zettel
Zettel is atomic.
Literature is about connecting the dots.
___
Zettel prevents the duplication of one subject. e.g. Reading different C++ books refers to same conceptm, virtual function.
Literature helps you recall what you have done and when you have done sth. Atom is powerful while connecting atoms is more powerful.
