- 📝Definition
	- The adjacency matrix representation of a [[Graph]] consists of $n$ lists one for each vertex $v_i$, $1\leq i\leq n$, which gives the vertices to which $v_i$ is adjacent.
	- The adjacency matrix, sometimes also called the connection matrix, of a simple labeled graph is a matrix with rows and columns labeled by graph vertices, with a $1$ or $0$ in position ($v_i,v_j$) according to whether $v_i$ and $v_j$ are adjacent or not.
	- > ==**Note⚠**==: Adjacency List only stores top-dimensional [[simplices]]. For example, it only stores information of faces from a [[tetrahedron]]..

	- TODO seems like the following diagram is a classic way of implementing Adjacency List.
- 🎯Intent
	- In [[Graph Theory]] and computer science, an adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph.
- 🚀Pros
	- simple, small storage cost
- 🕳Cons
	- hard to iterate over, e.g. expensive to access its neighbors
