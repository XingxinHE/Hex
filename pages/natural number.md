# 📝Definition
The natural numbers are be defined by the [[Peano's Axioms]].

> [!info] Remark
> The definition of the natural numbers is [[axiom|axiomatic]] rather than [[constructive proof|constructive]]. a.k.a. The natural numbers are not been told what they are, instead we have only listed some things you can do with them. Therefore, there is no infinite natural number, even $987513974592348758249527847..$ can be deducted by the 5 axioms. But, the [[set]] of natural numbers is infinite.
