# 📝Definition
## 📄Definition - diffeomorphism
Given two manifolds ${\displaystyle M}$ and ${\displaystyle N}$, a [[differentiable]] [[Function|map]] ${\displaystyle f\colon M\rightarrow N}$ is called a diffeomorphism if it is a bijection and its inverse ${\displaystyle f^{-1}\colon N\rightarrow M}$ is differentiable as well. If these functions are ${\displaystyle k}$ times continuously differentiable, ${\displaystyle f}$ is called a ${\displaystyle C^{k}}$-diffeomorphism.

## 📑Definition - diffeomorphic
Two manifolds $M$ and $N$ are diffeomorphic (usually denoted ${\displaystyle M\simeq N}$) if there is a diffeomorphism $f$ from $M$ to $N$. They are $C^{k}$-diffeomorphic if there is an $k$ times continuously differentiable bijective map between them whose inverse is also $k$ times continuously differentiable.
