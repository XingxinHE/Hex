- 📝Definition
    - A raster image is simply a 2D array that stores the pixel value for each pixel - usually a color stored as three numbers, for $\red{\text{red}}$, $\green{\text{green}}$, and $\blue{\text{blue}}$. A raster image stored in memory can be displayed by using each pixel in the stored image to control the color of one pixel of the display.
    
- 🧠Intuition
    - It’s best to think of a raster image as a device-independent description of the image to be displayed, and the display device as away of approximating that ideal image.
    
- 🤳Applicability
