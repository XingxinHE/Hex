- # ðŸŽ¯Intent
	- A well-structured graphical app <u>separates</u> the design of the <u>user interface</u> from the <u>data</u> that the application uses and the <u>business logic</u> that comprises the functionality of the app.
- # ðŸ¤³Applicability
	- use the <u>Modelâ€“Viewâ€“ViewModel</u> pattern
	- use <u>data binding</u> to display and modify data in a view
	- create a <u>ViewModel</u> with which a view can <u>interact with a model</u>
- # ðŸ§ªComposition
	- <u>the model</u> provides the **data** used by the app
	- <u>the view</u> represents the way in which the **data is displayed in the UI**
	- <u>the ViewModel</u> contains the **logic that connects the two**, taking the user input and converting it into commands that perform business operations on the model, and also taking the data from the model and formatting it in the manner expected by the view.
