# 📝Definition
Byte is the basic unit of addressing in most computers. Typically, a byte holds 8 [[Bit|bits]]. 1 Byte = 8 [[Bit]]s which is large enough to hold a value of type `char`.

# 🎯Intent
To make it easier to store information, individual [[Bit]] are collected together into larger units that are then treated as integral units of storage. The smallest such combined unit is called byte.
