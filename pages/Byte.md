- ## 📝Definition
	- 1 Byte = 8 [[Bit]]s which is large enough to hold a value of type `char`.
- ## 🎯Intent
	- To make it easier to store information, individual [[Bit]] are collected together into larger units that are then treated as integral units of storage. The smallest such combined unit is called byte.
