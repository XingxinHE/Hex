- 📝Definition
    - A sparse matrix is a matrix that allows special techniques to take advantage of the large number of "background" (commonly zero) elements.
    
- 🧠Intuition

        - 📝Definition
            - In practice, it’s essential to use a **sparse matrix**, i.e., a data structure that efficiently stores only the location and value of nonzero entries.
