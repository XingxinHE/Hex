# ðŸš€Benefit / Pros
The garbage collector provides the following benefits:
-   Frees developers from having to manually release memory.
-   Allocates objects on the managed heap efficiently.
-   Reclaims objects that are no longer being used, clears their memory, and keeps the memory available for future allocations. Managed objects automatically get clean content to start with, so their constructors don't have to initialize every data field.
