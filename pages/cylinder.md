# 📝Definition
The term "cylinder" has a number of related meanings.

**📑Definition in geometry**
- In #SolidGeometry  , the word "cylinder" refers to a solid bounded by a closed [[cylindrical surface|generalized cylinder]] and two parallel [[plane]]s. A cylinder of this sort having a polygonal base is therefore a [[prism]].
- In general #geometry sense, the term "cylinder" is commonly used not only to refer to the solid bounded by a cylindrical surface, but to the cylindrical surface **itself**.

> [!info] Remark
> For this branch. see [[cylindrical surface|generalized cylinder]].


**📃Definition in topology**
In #topology  , a cylindrical surface is not even a true surface, but rather a so-called surface with boundary.

**📄most common definition**
When used without qualification, the term "cylinder" generally refers to the particular case of a **right circular cylinder**.

> [!info] Remark
> A cylinder is called a **right** cylinder if it is "straight" in the sense that its cross sections lie directly on top of each other; otherwise, the cylinder is said to be **oblique**.
