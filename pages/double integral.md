# 📝Definition
The double integral of a function $f(x,y)$ over a region $R$ is the volume under the graph $z=f(x,y)$ above the region $R$ (the region $R$ is a subset of the $xy$-plane).
$$
\iint _{R} f(x,y) \mathop{d A}= \text{Volume under graph $z=f(x,y)$ above $R$}
$$

Rigorous 
$$
\textbf{(Rigorous Definition)} \quad \iint _{R} f(x,y) \mathop{d A}= \lim _{n \to \infty } \sum _{i=1}^{n} f(x_i, y_i) \text{Area}(A_i)
$$
where $A_1, \dots , A_n$ are obtained by cutting $R$ into $n$ non-overlapping pieces whose areas go to zero as $n\to\infty$, and each $(x_i,y_i)$ is a point in $A_i$.
