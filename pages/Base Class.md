# 📝Definition
A [[type]] that is intended to be derived from (e.g., has a non- `final`  virtual function), and [[object]]s of the type are intended to be used only indirectly (e.g., by pointer). [In strict terms, “base class” could be defined as “something we derived from” but we are specifying in terms of the class designer’s intent.] Typically a base class has one or more virtual functions.
