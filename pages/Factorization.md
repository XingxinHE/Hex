- # 🍴Quick Digest -> Factorization
	- ## 📝Definition
	  In mathematics, factorization or factoring consists of writing a number or another mathematical object as a product of several factors, usually **smaller** or **simpler** objects of the same kind.
	- ## 🧠Intuition
	  Transform a mathematical object into a set of smaller or simpler objects.
	- ## 🏷(Sub)Categories
	  In terms of the difference of the determination of a set:
		- a set of factors (divisors) of a given integer, this is [[prime factorization]]
			- e.g. $3\times5$ is a factorization of the integer $15$
		- a set of factors (divisors) of polynomial, this is [[polynomial factorization]]
			- e.g. $(x – 2)(x + 2)$ is a factorization of the polynomial $x^2 – 4$
