# 📝Definition
- In mathematics, factorization or factoring consists of writing a number or another mathematical object as a product of several factors, usually **smaller** or **simpler** objects of the same kind.

# 🧠Intuition
- Transform a mathematical object into a set of smaller or simpler objects.

# 🏷(Sub)Categories
- In terms of the difference of the determination of a set:
- a set of factors (divisors) of a given integer, this is [[prime factorization]]
    - e.g. $3\times5$ is a factorization of the integer $15$
    
- a set of factors (divisors) of polynomial, this is [[polynomial factorization]]
    - e.g. $(x – 2)(x + 2)$ is a factorization of the polynomial $x^2 – 4$

(2)&x^2+2ax+a^2 = (x+a)^2\\
(3)&x^2-2ax+a^2 = (x-a)^2\\
(4)&x^2+(a+b)x+ab = (x+a)(x+b)\\
(5)&x^3+3ax^2+3a^2x+a^3 = (x+a)^3\\
(6)&x^3-3ax^2+3a^2x-a^3 = (x-a)^3\\
(7)&x^3+a^3=(x+a)(x^2-ax+a^2)\\
(8)&x^3-a^3=(x-a)(x^2+ax+a^2)\\
(9)&x^{2n}-a^{2n}=(x^n-a^n)(x^n+a^n)\\
