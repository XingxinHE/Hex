- 📝Definition
    - A vector image is described by storing descriptions of shapes—areas of color bounded by lines or curves - with no reference to any particular pixel grid.
    
- 🧠Intuition
    - Vector image stores the instruction to display rather than the pixels needed to display it.
    
- 🚀Benefit / Pros
    - Vector image is resolution independent and can be displayed well on very-high-resolution devices.
    
- 🕳Pitfalls / Cons
    - They must be rasterized before they can be displayed.
