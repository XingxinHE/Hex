# 📝Definition
A quadric surface is the graph of a **second**-degree equation in *3* variables $x, y$, and $z$.

# ✒Notation
The most general such equation is
$$
Ax^2 + By^2 + Cz^2 + Dxy + Eyz + Fxz + Gx + Hy + Iz + J = 0
$$
where $A, B, C, . . . , J$ are constants, but by translation and rotation it can be brought into one of the two standard forms
$$
Ax^2 + By^2 + Cz^2 + J = 0
$$
or
$$
Ax^2 + By^2 + Iz = 0
$$
