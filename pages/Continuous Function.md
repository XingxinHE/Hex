- ## 📝Definition
	- A function $f(x)$ is [[continuous]] if for every point $c$ in the domain of $f(x)$ , the function $f$ is continuous at the point $x=c$.
- ## 🗃Example
  The following is example related to continuous functions.
	- 📌Common Continuous Functions
	  	The following functions are continuous at **all real numbers**:
	  		all polynomials
	  		$\sqrt[3]{x}$
	  		$|x|$
	  		$\cos x$ and $\sin x$
	  		exponential function $a^x$ with base $a>0$
	  	The following functions are continuous *__at the specified values__* of $x$ :
	  		$\sqrt{x}$ , for $x>0$
	  		$\tan x$ , at all $x$ where it is defined
	  		logarithmic functions $\log_{a}x$ with base $a>0$ , for $x>0$
