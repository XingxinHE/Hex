# 📝Definition
## $\mathbb{R}^2$
A point $(x_0 , y_0)$ is a boundary point of region ([[set]]) $R$ if every disk centered at $(x_0 , y_0)$ contains points that lie outside of $R$ as well as points that lie in $R$. (The boundary point itself need not belong to $R$.)

## $\mathbb{R}^3$
A point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is a boundary point of $R$ if every solid ball centered at $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ contains points that lie outside of $R$ as well as points that lie inside $R$.
