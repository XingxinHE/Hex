# 📝Definition
For two sets $A$ and $B$, we say that $A$ is a subset of $B$, written $A\subseteq B$, if every member of $A$ also is a member of $B$.

> [!info] Remark
> Nothing in this definition requires $A$ to be different from $B$; in fact, if $A = B$, it is true that both $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$.

# ✒Notation
When we talk about "subset", some use $A\subset B$ while others use $A\subseteq B$.
> [!info] Remark
> I prefer the $A\subseteq B$ which is mentioned in [[📺Theory of Computation]].
