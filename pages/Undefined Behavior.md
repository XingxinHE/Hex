# ðŸ˜²Intuitive Explanation
you can't reliably predict what will happen at [[run-time]].

# ðŸ˜·Symptoms
The program will behave erratically:
- sometime running normally
- other times crashing
- other times produce incorrect results

# âŒ¨Sample Code
- 2 examples of code with undefined behavior
  
  ``` c++
  
  int *p = 0;		//p is a null pointer
  std::cout << *p;	//dereferencing a null pointer yields undefined behavior
  
  char name[] = "Darla";  //name is an array of size 6(including the last null)
  char c = name[10];		//referring to an invalid array index yields undefined behavior
  ``` ^2a05b7d5f62b6f91
