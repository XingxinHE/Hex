# 📝Definition
The **calculus of variations** is a field of mathematical analysis that uses variations, which are small changes in functions and [[functional]]s, to **find maxima and minima** of functionals: mappings from a [[set]] of functions to the [[real number]]s.

# ✒Notation
Functionals are often expressed as [[definite integral]]s involving functions and their [[derivative]]s.
