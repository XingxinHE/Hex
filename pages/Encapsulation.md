- # 📝Definition
	- Encapsulation is an <u>important</u> principle <u>when defining classes</u>.
	- The idea is that a program that uses a class should not have to account for how that class actually works internally; the program simply creates an instance of a class and calls the methods of that class. e.g. You use `Console.WriteLine` as it is. And you don't care how it implements inside.
	  ```c#
	  Consolw.WriteLine("Hello World!");
	  ```
- # 🎯Intent
	- **Combine** data and methods within a class.   (how to <u>define</u> a class)
	- **Control** the accessibility of the data and methods.  (how to <u>use</u> a class)
