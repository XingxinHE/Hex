# 📝Definition
A function with $k$ [[continuity|continuous]] [[derivative]]s is called a $C^k$ [[function]].

## real-valued function
Let $k$ be a nonnegative [[integer]]. A [[real-valued function]] $f : U \to \mathbb{R}^3$ is said to be $C^k$ at $p \in U$ if its [[partial derivative]]s 
$$
\frac{\partial^j f}{\partial x^{i_1}\dots\partial x^{i_j}}
$$
of all orders $j\leq k$ exist and are [[continuity|continuous]] at $p$.

## vector-valued function
A [[vector-valued function]] $f:U\to\mathbb{R}^m$ is said to be $C^k$ at $p$ if all of its component functions $f^1,\dots,f^m$ are $C^k$ at $p$. We say that $f : U \to \mathbb{R}^m$ is $C^k$ on $U$ if it is $C^k$ at every point in $U$.
