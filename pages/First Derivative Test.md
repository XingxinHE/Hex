# 📝Definition
- The first-derivative test examines a function's monotonic properties (where the function is increasing or decreasing), focusing on a particular point in its domain.

# 🧠Intuition
- Find the function's [[extremum]] point.

# 🧀Applicability
- 📌Finding [[Local Minima]] and [[Local Maxima]]
    - Suppose the $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=a$ and has a [[Critical Point]] at $x=a$
        - $f$ has a local minimum at $x=a$ if $f'(x)<0$ just to the left of $a$ and $f'(x)>0$ just to the right of $a$.
          ![local minima](../assets/local_minima.svg)
        - $f$ has a local maximum at $x=a$ if $f'(x)>0$ just to the left of $a$ and $f'(x)<0$ just to the right of $a$.
          ![local maxima](../assets/local_maxima.svg)
        - The point $x=a$ is neither a local minimum nor a local maximum of $f$ if $f'(x)$ has the same sign just to the left of $a$ and just to the right of $a$.

# 🗃Example
- 📌Example 1 - Use first derivative test to find local extrema
    - Question: List all $x$-values of points at which the function
      $$
      g(x)=x^5/5+2x^4+4x^3-17
      $$
      has a local extrema.
    - Solution:
        - 1)Find the critical point by $g'(x)$
            - $$
              g'(x)=x^4+8x^3+12x^2=x^2(x+6)(x+2)=0
              $$
            - result is  $x=0, -6, -2$
            
        - 2)Then we can draw the diagram as followed
            - ![name](../assets/critical_point_1.svg){:height 300, :width 300}
            
        - 3)Then we need to know the sign except the 3 critical points.
            - $g'(-10)=3200$, so $g'$ is positive on $(-\infin, -6)$
            - $g'(-4)=-64$, so $g'$ is negative on $(-6, -2)$
            - $g'(-1)=5$, so $g'$ is positive on $(-2, 0)$
            - $g'(1)=21$, so $g'$ is positive on $(0, +\infin)$
            
        - 4)we can draw the diagram as followed
          ![name](../assets/exclude_critical_point_1.svg){:height 72, :width 360}
        - 5) Then we knew
            - local minimum: $x=-2$
            - local maximum: $x=-6$
            
- 📌Example 2 - Use first derivative test to find local extrema
    - Question: List all $x$ -values of points at which the function  
      $$
      h(x)=1.5x^{2/3}+x
      $$
      has a local extrema.
    - Solution:
        - 1)Find the critical point by $h'(x)$
            - $$
              h'(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x}}+1
              $$
            - result is
                - at $x=0$ is not defined
                - at $x=-1$ is $h'(x)=0$
                
        - 2)Then we can draw the diagram as followed
            - ![name](../assets/critical_point_2.svg){:height 300, :width 300}
            
        - 3)Then we need to know the sign except the 2 critical points.
            - $h'(-8)=1/2$ , so $g'$ is positive on $(-\infin, -1)$
            - $h'(-1/8)=-1$ , so $g'$ is negative on $(-1, 0)$
            - $h'(1)=2$ , so $g'$ is positive on $(0, +\infin)$
            
        - 4)we can draw the diagram as followed  
          ![name](../assets/exclude_critical_point_2.svg)
        - 5) Then we knew
            - local minimum: $x=0$
            - local maximum: $x=-1$
