- # 🍴Quick Digest -> Extreme Value Theorem
	- ## 📝Definition
	  id:: 90ec8a00-13d6-4e48-9809-1a84673fd561
	  If $f$ is **continuous** on a closed interval $[a,b]$, then there are points at which $f$ attains its maximum and its minimum on $[a,b]$. It is important to note that this is only guaranteed if the interval is **finite** and **closed**.
	- ## 🧪Composition
	  Under the guarantee by extreme value theorem, the candidates of extrema([[minimum]] & [[maximum]]) can only be attained
		- at
			- either [[Critical Point]]s
			- or endpoints. a.k.a. the boundary of that interval.
		- so we just need to run through all of those candidates to find the largest and smallest values of $f$.
	- ## 🧠Intuition
	  Under certain [condition](((90ec8a00-13d6-4e48-9809-1a84673fd561))), we can always find min and max.
	- ## 🧮Expression
	  $$
	  \begin{align}
	  f(x)&=
	  \end{align}
	  $$
