# 📝Definition
If $f$ is **continuous** on a closed interval $[a,b]$, then there are points at which $f$ attains its maximum and its minimum on $[a,b]$. It is important to note that this is only guaranteed if the interval is **finite** and **closed**.

# 🧪Composition
Under the guarantee by extreme value theorem, the candidates of extrema( #minimum & #maximum ) can only be attained
- at
    - either [[Critical Point]]s
    - or endpoints. a.k.a. the boundary of that interval.
    
- so we just need to run through all of those candidates to find the largest and smallest values of $f$.

# 🧠Intuition
Under certain [[#Definition|condition]], we can always find min and max.

# 🗃Example
Example is the most straightforward way to understand a mathematical concept.
