- ## 📝Definition
  id:: 90ec8a00-13d6-4e48-9809-1a84673fd561
  If $f$ is **continuous** on a closed interval $[a,b]$, then there are points at which $f$ attains its maximum and its minimum on $[a,b]$. It is important to note that this is only guaranteed if the interval is **finite** and **closed**.
- ## 🧪Composition
  Under the guarantee by extreme value theorem, the candidates of extrema( #minimum & #maximum ) can only be attained
	- at
		- either [[Critical Point]]s
		- or endpoints. a.k.a. the boundary of that interval.
	- so we just need to run through all of those candidates to find the largest and smallest values of $f$.
- ## 🧠Intuition
  Under certain [condition](((90ec8a00-13d6-4e48-9809-1a84673fd561))), we can always find min and max.
- ## 🗃Example
  Example is the most straightforward way to understand a mathematical concept.
