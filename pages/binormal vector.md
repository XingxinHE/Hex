# 📝Definition
The binormal vector of a curve in space is $\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{T} \times \mathbf{N}$, a [[unit vector]] orthogonal to both $\mathbf{T}$ and $\mathbf{N}$.
- $\mathbf{T}$ denotes [[tangent vector|unit tangent vector]]
- $\times$ denotes [[cross product]]
- $\mathbf{N}$ denotes [[normal vector|principal unit normal vector]]


# 🧠Intuition
The binormal vector is the tendency of your motion to “==twist==” out of the plane created by these vectors in the direction perpendicular to this plane.

# 🗃Example
Example is the most straightforward way to understand a mathematical concept.
