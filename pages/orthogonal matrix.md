# 📝Definition
A $n\times n$ matrix $A$ is an orthogonal matrix if
$$
AA^T=I,
$$
where $A^T$ is the transpose of $A$ and $I$ is the [[identity matrix]]. In particular, an orthogonal matrix is always invertible, and
$$
A^{-1}=A^T.
$$

In component form, an orthogonal matrix satisfies
$$
(a^{-1})_{ij}=a_{ji}
$$
