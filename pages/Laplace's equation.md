# 📝Definition
Laplace's equation is a second-order [[partial differential equation]].

# ✒Notation
This is often written as
$$
\nabla ^{2}f=0
$$
or
$$
\Delta f=0.
$$
where
 - ${\displaystyle \Delta =\nabla \cdot \nabla =\nabla ^{2}}$ is [[Laplace operator]]. 😲Yes. There are 3 types of representation of it.
 - $\nabla \cdot$ is the [[divergence]] operator
 - $\nabla$ is the [[gradient]] operator
 - $f(x,y,z)$ is twice-[[differentiable]] [[real-valued function]]

## 🍎Laplace's equation vs. Poisson's equation
Poisson's equation is a generalization of Laplace's equation. For example, let the right-hand side is specified as a given function $h(x,y,z)$, we have
$$
{\displaystyle \Delta f=h.}
$$
Then the preceding is a [[Poisson's equation]].
