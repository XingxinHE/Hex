# 📝Definition and Classification
- Standard C++ refers to the type qualifiers [[const]] and [[volatile]] as cv-qualifiers. In both languages, the cv-qualifiers are only meaningful in expressions that are lvalues.

# 😲Intuitive Explanation
The word "qualifier" means that the `const` and `volatile` can be used **interchangable**.
