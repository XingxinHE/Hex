# 📝Definition
## general
A $C^{\infty}$ function is a [[function]] that is [[differentiable]] for ==all degrees== of differentiation. 

## rigorous definition
**📋Prerequisite**
> [!info]
> To rigorously define a $C^{\infty}$ function, we must first review the [[C-k function]] as followed.

Let $k$ be a nonnegative [[integer]]. A [[real-valued function]] $f : U \to \mathbb{R}^3$ is said to be $C^k$ at $p \in U$ if its [[partial derivative]]s 
$$
\frac{\partial^j f}{\partial x^{i_1}\dots\partial x^{i_j}}
$$
of all orders $j\leq k$ exist and are [[continuity|continuous]] at $p$.

**📑Definition**
The function $f : U \to\mathbb{R}$ is $C^{\infty}$ at $p$ if it is $C^k$ for all $k \geq 0$; in other words, its [[partial derivative]]s 
$$
\frac{\partial^j f}{\partial x^{i_1}\dots\partial x^{i_j}}
$$
of **all orders** exist and are continuous at $p$.
