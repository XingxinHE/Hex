# ðŸ§ Intuition
`do` in abstract
```
do
{
	statement
}while(Boolean expression)
```
# âŒ¨Sample Code
- in #csharp 
	- 
	  ```csharp
	  int i = 0;
		do
		{
			Console.WriteLine(i);
			i++;
		} while (i < 10);  //don't forget the ;  here
	  ```

# ðŸŒ“Complement
## while vs. do-while
In short, `do-while` has to **do it at least once** before iterating!
