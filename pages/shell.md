- # üìñBasic Knowledge
	- **üìå environment variable(PATH)**
		- All the commands you run in the shell has already been added to the  `environment variable`  in your PC. In Windows, you can search  `edit the system environment variable`  =>  `environment variable..`  => Edit the  `PATH` .
	- **üìå `/` and `\`**
		- A path on the shell is a **delimited** list of directories;
		- on Linux and macOS:
			- > ‚Äã	path separated by `/` 
			  >
			  > ‚Äã	`/` means the "root"
		- on Windows:
			- > ‚Äã	path separated by `\` 
			  >
			  > ‚Äã	`C:\` means the "root"
	- **üìå absolute path and relative path**
		- a.**Absolute path** is with full path (literally). e.g.
			- In windows,
				- `C:\Users\Xingxin\AppData\Local\Temp`
			- In Linux and macOS:
				- path starts with `/` is *absolute*
		- b.**Relative path** *takes the advantage of environment variable* to form an absolute path.  e.g.
			- `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp`
	- **üìå `.` , `..` , `~` , `-`   used in path**
		- It is a must to know these 3 symbols for they appear a lot.
			- `.` means current directory, e.g. `cd ./tutorial` change dir to the tutorial folder which under **current** dir.
			- `..` means the parent directory, e.g. `cd ..` change dir to its parent dir.
			- `~` means the **home** directory. e.g. `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa` add the ssh key in the "*HOME* folder/.ssh/"
			- `-` means the previous directory in the prompt
	- **üìå `-` , `--`  used in command**
		- `-` indicates a flag which **modify** their behavior
		- `--` indicates an options
		- *example*:
			- ```bash
			  ls -l
			  ```
			- The `-l` flag asks the `ls` command to list the files in a *a long listing format*.
		- *example*:
			- ```bash
			  git log --stat
			  ```
			- The `--stat` option indicates the `git` command to show the *statistics* from `git log`.
