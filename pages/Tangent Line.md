# 📝Definition
- The **tangent line** to a function $f(x)$ at the point $x=a$ is the line that passes through the point $(a,f(a))$, and whose slope is the instantaneous rate of change of $f(x)$ at the point $x=a$. This slope is the slope of the line you get <u>if you imagine zooming in on the function until it looks like a line</u>.

# 🧪Composition
- How do you define a tangent line?
	- Point $(a,f(a))$
	- Slope $m, \text{where }m=f'(a)$
