- # üç±Regular Procedures
	- ## üçíCherry-pick
	  collapsed:: true
		- üìårecipe 1: cherry-pick changes from master to release
		  id:: 634ff98f-2d88-4cbe-a15f-c81bea32d5fa
			- Update master branch to latest change
				- ``` shell
				  git pull origin master
				  ```
			- Pull release branch to local
				- ``` shell
				  git checkout -b release origin/release
				  ```
			- cherry-pick change to release branch from master
				- ``` shell
				  git cherry-pick <commit-guid>
				  ```
				- P.S. the `commit-guid` must exist in `master` branch
			- Push changes to remote git repo
				- ``` shell
				  git push origin release:<name>/<feature>
				  ```
				- The preceding command will create a new branch for pull request
	- ## Clone and Submodule
		- üìå Setup for recursive clone
		  collapsed:: true
			- You want to combine several dependencies into one project when you work on a macro project.
			- Procedure
				- create a `.gitmodules` in the root of your `git` folder.
				- define **what** `git` repo will be in which **location** of your main folder.
				- üìÑ`.gitmodules`
				  ```
				  [submodule "<name_of_this_repo"]
				  	path = <location_of_this_submodule>
				  	url = <url_of_this_repo>
				  - //e.g.
				  [submodule "deps/polyscope"]
				  	path = deps/polyscope
				  	url = https://github.com/nzfeng/polyscope.git
				  [submodule "deps/googletest"]
				  	path = deps/googletest
				  	url = https://github.com/google/googletest.git
				  ```
				- Use the following commands to setup.
				  
				  ``` shell
				  git clone <repo_url>
				  git submodule init
				  git submodule update --depth 10
				  ```
		- üóëUnorganized
			- what do the following mean...
			- ```cmd
			  git submodule add --depth 1 git@gitee.com:shanghai-dajie-robot/pocket_raichu.git submodules/pocket_raichu
			  git config -f .gitmodules submodule.pocket_raichu.shallow true
			  ```
			- ```
			  git config -f .gitmodules submodule.submodules/pocket_raichu.shallow false
			  ```
	- ## Worktree
		- üìùDefinition
			- A Git worktree is a linked copy of your Git repository, allowing you to have multiple branches checked out at a time.
		- üìåWhat you can't do using worktree
			- in `CGAL`
				- checkout at `master` branch
			- in `CGAL_release2022`
				- you can checkout all the branches except `master` branch, and vice versa
		- üìåMake a worktree
			- Suppose you have 2 branches. `main` and `hotfix`, now you are in `hotfix` branch. You want to create a folder for `main`
			- ``` shell
			  git worktree add ~/repo_hotfix main
			  ```
				- which `~/repo_hotfix` is where you want the repo put. `main` is the branch you want the new repo based on.
			- ``` shell
			  git worktree add -b feature_2023 ~/repo_2023 main
			  ```
				- this version is checkout a new branch for the worktree.
	- ## Conflict
		- üìåSolve Cherry-pick conflict
			- Solve the conflicts
				- Find which files are with conflict
				- Open the file with VSCode(my personal preference)
					- Solve the conflicts
					- `git add/rm <pathspec>` the conflict files. You can either `add` or `rm`
				- And then `git cherry-pick --continue`
			- Skip to solve
				- `git cherry-pick --skip`
			- Abort and go back to the state
				- `git cherry-pick --abort`
			-
	- ## Github
		- üìåSetup a Github Access Token
			- 1. Go to the Github account - Developer Setting - Generate Token
			- 2. Git clone an arbitrary repo from your page
			- 3. When the computer request credential, just close it until it appears on the command line for the following info
			     1. `user_name`: the name of your Github account
			     2. `password`: paste your token here
	- ## Merge
		- üìå How to solve conflicts?
			- Suppose you are on `master`, and you want to merge `new_feature` branch, the conflict is on `main.cpp`. Then you can do:
			- ```bash
			  git merge new_feature
			  ```
			- You will see the feedback from the prompt saying there are conflicts. You open the `main.cpp` which was decorated with some notation from `git` . Here I use VS Code, you can also use Vim.
			- ```bash
			  code main.cpp
			  ```
			- You manually fix the conflicts. Then you should **add it to the staging area**!(because you literally fix it)
			- ```bash
			  git add main.cpp
			  ```
			- Finally you ask `git` to continue the merging job.
			- ```bash
			  git merge --continue
			  ```

- üìàDiagram
	- TODO Diagram of git concept
- # Basic Concepts
	- Repository
		- In short, a Git *repository*: it is the data  `objects`  and  `references` .
	- Data Model
		- The following mimics the data model in Git in pseudocode.
		- **File**: it is a bunch of bytes
			- ```
			  type blob = array<byte>
			  ```
		- **Directory**: It contains named files and directories
			- ```
			  type tree = map<string, tree | blob>
			  ```
		- **Commit**: It has parents, metadata, and the top-level tree
			- ```
			  type commit = struct 
			  {
			    parents: array<commit>
			    author: string
			    message: string
			    snapshot: tree
			  }
			  ```
		- **Object**: It could be a blob, tree, or commit.
			- ```
			  type object = blob | tree | commit
			  ```
		- **Data Storage**: In Git data store, all objects are **content-addressed** by their [SHA-1 hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1).
			- ```
			  objects = map<string, object>
			  ‚Äã
			  def store(object):
			    id = sha1(object)
			    objects[id] = object
			  ‚Äã
			  def load(id):
			    return objects[id]
			  ```
		- **References**: They are pointers to commits. Convert *SHA-1 hash* to *human-readable names*.
			- ```
			  references = map<string, string>
			  ‚Äã
			  def update_reference(name, id):
			    references[name] = id
			  ‚Äã
			  def read_reference(name):
			    return references[name]
			  ‚Äã
			  def load_reference(name_or_id):
			    if name_or_id in references:
			   ¬† ¬†  return load(references[name_or_id])
			    else:
			   ¬† ¬†  return load(name_or_id)
			  ```
			- e.g.
				- `HEAD`  is the latest "where we currently are"
				- `master`  refers to a particular snapshot instead of a bunch of hexadecimal string.
	- Merge
		- üìå Fast-forward and three-way merge
			- Fast-forward: the commit all points to a same parent commit
			  ```
			  o <-- o <-- o <-- o <-- o
			  ```
			- Three-way merge:
				- master and sub no conflicts‚úî, different file
				- master and sub no conflicts‚úî, different modification in the same file
				- master and sub conflicts‚ùå
				- ```
				  o <-- o <-- o <-- o <---- o
				              ^            /
				               \          v
				                --- o <-- o
				  ```
	- üìåSnapshotsÂíîÂöì
		- Git models the history of a collection of files and folders within some top-level directory as a series of snapshots.
		  ```
		  <root> (tree)
		  |
		  +- foo (tree)
		  |  |
		  |  + bar.txt (blob, contents = "hello world")
		  |
		  +- baz.txt (blob, contents = "git is wonderful")
		  ```
	- üìåModeling history: relating snapshots
		- In pro words: a history is a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)** of snapshots
		- In human words: each snapshot in Git refers to a set of ‚Äúparents‚Äù, the snapshots that preceded it.
		- ```
		        this is a commit
		              ‚Üë
		  o <-- o <-- o <-- o
		              ^
		               \
		                --- o <-- o
		  new_feature      new_feature + bug_fix
		              ‚Üë               ‚Üó
		  o <-- o <-- o <-- o <---- o
		              ^            /
		               \          v
		                --- o <-- o
		                          ‚Üì
		                       bug_fix
		  ```
