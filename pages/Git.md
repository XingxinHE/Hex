- # üç±Regular Procedures
	- ## üçíCherry-pick
	  collapsed:: true
		- üìårecipe 1: cherry-pick changes from master to release
		  id:: 634ff98f-2d88-4cbe-a15f-c81bea32d5fa
			- Update master branch to latest change
				- ``` shell
				  git pull origin master
				  ```
			- Pull release branch to local
				- ``` shell
				  git checkout -b release origin/release
				  ```
			- cherry-pick change to release branch from master
				- ``` shell
				  git cherry-pick <commit-guid>
				  ```
				- P.S. the `commit-guid` must exist in `master` branch
			- Push changes to remote git repo
				- ``` shell
				  git push origin release:<name>/<feature>
				  ```
				- The preceding command will create a new branch for pull request
	- ## Clone
	  collapsed:: true
		- üìå Setup for recursive clone
			- You want to combine several dependencies into one project when you work on a macro project.
			- Procedure
				- create a `.gitmodules` in the root of your `git` folder.
				- define **what** `git` repo will be in which **location** of your main folder.
			- ```
			  [submodule "<name_of_this_repo"]
			  	path = <location_of_this_submodule>
			  	url = <url_of_this_repo>
			  - //e.g.
			  [submodule "deps/polyscope"]
			  	path = deps/polyscope
			  	url = https://github.com/nzfeng/polyscope.git
			  [submodule "deps/googletest"]
			  	path = deps/googletest
			  	url = https://github.com/google/googletest.git
			  ```
	- ## Worktree
		- üìùDefinition
			- A Git worktree is a linked copy of your Git repository, allowing you to have multiple branches checked out at a time.
		- üìåWhat you can't do using worktree
			- in `CGAL`
				- checkout at `master` branch
			- in `CGAL_release2022`
				- you can checkout all the branches except `master` branch, and vice versa
		- üìåMake a worktree
			- Suppose you have 2 branches. `main` and `hotfix`, now you are in `hotfix` branch. You want to create a folder for `main`
			- ``` shell
			  git worktree add ~/repo_hotfix main
			  ```
				- which `~/repo_hotfix` is where you want the repo put. `main` is the branch you want the new repo based on.
			- ``` shell
			  git worktree add -b feature_2023 ~/repo_2023 main
			  ```
				- this version is checkout a new branch for the worktree.
	- ## Conflict
		- üìåSolve Cherry-pick conflict
			- Solve the conflicts
				- Find which files are with conflict
				- Open the file with VSCode(my personal preference)
					- Solve the conflicts
					- `git add/rm <pathspec>` the conflict files. You can either `add` or `rm`
				- And then `git cherry-pick --continue`
			- Skip to solve
				- `git cherry-pick --skip`
			- Abort and go back to the state
				- `git cherry-pick --abort`
			-
	- ## Merge
		- üìå How to solve conflicts?
			- Suppose you are on `master`, and you want to merge `new_feature` branch, the conflict is on `main.cpp`. Then you can do:
			- ```bash
			  git merge new_feature
			  ```
			- You will see the feedback from the prompt saying there are conflicts. You open the `main.cpp` which was decorated with some notation from `git` . Here I use VS Code, you can also use Vim.
			- ```bash
			  code main.cpp
			  ```
			- You manually fix the conflicts. Then you should **add it to the staging area**!(because you literally fix it)
			- ```bash
			  git add main.cpp
			  ```
			- Finally you ask `git` to continue the merging job.
			- ```bash
			  git merge --continue
			  ```
