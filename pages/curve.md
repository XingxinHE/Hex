# 📝Definition
There are no fewer than ==**3**== distinct notions of curve throughout mathematics.
- In #topology , a curve is a one-dimensional [[continuum]].
- In #AlgebraicGeometry , an [[algebraic curve]] over a field $\mathbf{K}$ is the zero [[locus]] of some [[polynomial]] $f(X,Y)$ of two variables which has its coefficients in $K$.
- In #AnalyticGeometry , a [[smooth curve|curve]] is [[continuity|continuous]] map from a $1$-dimensional space to an $n$-dimensional space. Loosely speaking, the word "curve" is often used to mean the function graph of a $2-$ or $3-$dimensional curve. The simplest curves can be represented parametrically in $n$-dimensional space as
