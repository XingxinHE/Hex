# ðŸš¿Source
`try-catch` is just a mechanism for [[Error-Handling]], so what is its source? What kinds of error does `try-catch` block encounter?
- #cpp , #csharp use [[Exception]].


# #csharp 
## ðŸ§ Intuition
```csharp
try
{
    //the code may have errors
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    //handle the exception
}
```


## âŒ¨Sample Code
ðŸ“Œorder the catch with by inheritance
With [[Exception#Inheritance|inheritance characteristic]] of `Exception`, a #BestPractice is to handle the **specific exception in the head** and **general exception at the tail**.
```mermaid
graph TD
A(Error) --> B(catch specific exception A)
B(catch specific exception A) --> C(catch specific exception B)
C(catch specific exception B) --> D(catch general exception)
```
The following codes are an example.
```csharp
try
{
}
catch(FormatException fEx)
{
}
catch(OverflowException oEx)
{
}
catch(Exception ex)
{
}
```
