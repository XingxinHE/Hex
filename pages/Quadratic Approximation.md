- # 🍴Quick Digest -> Quadratic Approximation
	- ## 📝Definition
	  The quadratic approximation near $x=a$ is **the best fit parabola** to $f$ at the point $x=a$.
	  
	  The formula for the quadratic approximation of a function $f$ near a point $x=a$ is
	  $$
	  f(x)\approx f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)+\frac{f''(a)}{2}(x-a)^2
	  $$
	  When $a=0$, this quadratic approximation becomes
	  $$
	  f(x)\approx f(0)+f'(0)(x)+\frac{f''(0)}{2}(x)^2
	  $$
