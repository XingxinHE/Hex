		- 📌Find all $x$-values of points that are critical points of $g(x)=0.2x^5+2x^4+4x^3-17$
			- To find critical point, first calculate the derivative $g'(x)$ which is
			  $$
			  g'(x)=x^4+8x^3+12x^2=x^2(x+6)(x+2)=0
			  $$
			- Therefore we can have the critical points are $x=0, -6, -2$
		- 📌Find all $x$-values of points that are critical points of $h(x)=1.5x^{2/3}+x$
			- We can calculate the derivative
			  $$
			  h'(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x}}+1
			  $$
			- Note that $h'(x)$
				- at $x=0$ is not defined ,
				- at $x=-1$ is $h'(x)=0$
			- So the critical points are $x=0, -1$.
