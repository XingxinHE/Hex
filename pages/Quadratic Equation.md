alias:: quadratic function

- ## 📝Definition
	- A quadratic equation is a second-order [[polynomial equation]] in a single variable $x$
	  $$
	  ax^2+bx+c=0, 	
	  $$
	  with $a\neq0$. Because it is a second-order polynomial equation, the fundamental theorem of algebra guarantees that it has two solutions. These solutions may be both real, or both complex.

	- ### Quadratic Formula
	  The formula giving the [[Root]]s of a quadratic equation
	  $$
	  \begin{align}
	  x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
	  \end{align}
	  $$
- # ⛈Characteristics / Properties
	- 📌Discriminant
		- $$
		  \Delta = b^2-4ac
		  $$
		- The discriminant is relevant to the amount of roots.
			- $\Delta>0$, 2 roots.
			- $\Delta=0$, 1 root
			- $\Delta<0$, no roots

		- The monic quadratic is a quadratic with [leading coefficient](((6337e478-0ae9-4e45-8483-d96d719d49ba))) equal to 1.
		- ❌ not a monic quadratic => $2x^2-3x+10$
		- ✅ is a monic quadratic => $x^2-\frac{3}{2}x+5$

	- 📌Completing the Square
		- It is a technique to solve a quadratic equation.
		- Question
			- To solve $2x^2-3x+10$
		- Solution
			- Step 1. Change to [monic quadratic](((6337e938-3cb3-45c2-933e-18cbf53a89eb)))
				- $$
				  2x^2-3x+10=2(x^2-\frac{3}{2}x+5)
				  $$
			- Step 2. Think about completing the square of $\frac{3}{2}$
				- $$
				  2(x^2-\frac{3}{2}x+5)=2((x^2-\frac{3}{2}x+\frac{9}{16})+5-\frac{9}{16})
				  $$
			- Step 3.
				- $$
				  2(x^2-\frac{3}{2}x+\frac{9}{16}+5-\frac{9}{16})=2\bigg((x-\frac{3}{4})^2+\frac{71}{16}\bigg)
				  $$
