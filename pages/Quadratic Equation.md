- # 🍴Quick Digest -> Quadratic Equation
	- ## 📝Definition
	  A quadratic equation is a second-order [[polynomial equation]] in a single variable $x$
	  $$
	  ax^2+bx+c=0, 	
	  $$
	  with $a\neq0$. Because it is a second-order polynomial equation, the fundamental theorem of algebra guarantees that it has two solutions. These solutions may be both real, or both complex.
