alias:: vector product

- ## 📝Definition
	- The cross product of two $3$-vectors $P$ and $Q$, written as $P\times Q$, is a vector quantity given by the formula.
		- $$
		  P\times Q = \langle P_yQ_z-P_zQ_y,\space P_zQ_x-P_xQ_z,\space P_xQ_y-P_yQ_x\rangle
		  $$
	- Cross product in **matrix picture**(also known as **pseudodeterminant**), where $i,j,k$ are unit vector:
		- $$
		  P\times Q = 
		  \begin{vmatrix}
		  \bold{i}&\bold{j}&\bold{k}\\
		  P_x&P_y&P_z\\
		  Q_x&Q_y&Q_z
		  \end{vmatrix}\\\\
		  i=\langle1,0,0\rangle\\
		  j=\langle0,1,0\rangle\\
		  k=\langle0,0,1\rangle\\
		  $$

		- ⚠**Attention:** the sign in front of j is **negative**! Others are positive.
	- **cross product** is also known as **vector product** which **returns a vector** rather than an scalar.
- ## 🧠Intuition
	- It **calculates surface normal** at a particular point given two distinct tangent vectors.
