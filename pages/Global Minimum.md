- 📝Definition
	- A point $x^*$ is a global minimum if $f(x^*)\leq f(x)$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$​.
	- A global minimum, also known as an absolute minimum, is the smallest overall value of a set, function, etc., over its entire range.

	- A difficult case for global minimization

		- So in future practice, we should pay attention to those crazy function may be "trapped".
- 🕳Pitfalls
	- It is impossible to construct an algorithm that will find a global minimum for an arbitrary function.
