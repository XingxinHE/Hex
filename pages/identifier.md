# 📝Definition
Identifier is a [[Tuple|sequence]] of [[character]]s that you use to identify the elements in your programs, such as

-   Enumerated type name
-   Member of a class, structure, union, or enumeration
-   Function or class-member function
-   typedef name

# 🧠Intuition
Identifiers are literally the composition of English character, numbers, and symbols.

## Identifier vs. Variable
I think they are very similar to each others.
- identifier is to be "==identified==" by the [[compiler]].
- The name of variable is an identifier while variable also contains value.
> [!NOTE] 
> Sometimes people use "identifier" and variable interchangeably.
