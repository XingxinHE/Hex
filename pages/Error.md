	- ## 🏷(Sub)Categories
	  There are many ways of classifying errors. For example:
		- Compile-time errors: Errors found by the compiler. We can further classify compile-time errors based on which language rules they violate, for example:
			- Syntax errors
			- Type errors
		- Link-time errors: Errors found by the linker when it is trying to combine object fi les into an executable program.
		- Run-time errors: Errors found by checks in a running program. We can further classify run-time errors as
			- Errors detected by the computer (hardware and/or operating system)
			- Errors detected by a library (e.g., the standard library)
			- Errors detected by user code
		- Logic errors: Errors found by the programmer looking for the causes of erroneous results.
