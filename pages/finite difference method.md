# 📝Definition
Finite-difference methods (FDM) are a class of numerical techniques for solving [[differential equation]]s by approximating [[derivative]]s with finite differences. Both the spatial domain and time interval (if applicable) are discretized, or broken into a finite number of steps, and the value of the solution at these discrete points is approximated by solving algebraic equations containing finite differences and values from nearby points.

# 🎯Intent
Finite difference methods convert ordinary differential equations (ODE) or partial differential equations (PDE), which may be nonlinear, into a system of linear equations that can be solved by matrix algebra techniques.
