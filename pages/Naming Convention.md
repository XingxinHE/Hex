- In C++, never write variable name starting with `_` since such names are reserved for implementation and system entities.

- The C++ language and standard library don’t use the initial-capital-letter style, so it’s `int` rather than `Int` and `string` rather than `String`. Thus, our convention helps to minimize confusion between our types and the standard ones. ^6e89cb96fbb85250

## ⚖Laws
-   Don't start with underscore. e.g. `_Day`❌
-   Don’t create identifiers that differ only by case! e.g. 2 variables `myName`and`Myname`❌
-   Start with lower case. e.g. `myAge`✅
-   Use camelCase(1st word lower case, 2nd word upper case). e.g. `myTotalHeight`✅
    
## 🗃Example
-   `score`✅
-   `footBallTeam`✅
-   `_score`❌ (valid but not recommend)
-   `FootBallTeam`❌ (valid but not recommend)
> [!danger] 
> words started with`_` can't be used in Visual Basic which is also .NET Framework
