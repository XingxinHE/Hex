- In C++, never write variable name starting with `_` since such names are reserved for implementation and system entities.
- The C++ language and standard library don’t use the initial-capital-letter style, so it’s `int` rather than `Int` and `string` rather than `String`. Thus, our convention helps to minimize confusion between our types and the standard ones.
