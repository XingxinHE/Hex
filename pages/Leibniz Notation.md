# 📝Definition
Leibniz notation uses the symbols $dx$ and $dy$ to represent infinitely small (or infinitesimal) increments of $x$ and $y$, respectively, just as $Δx$ and $Δy$ represent finite increments of $x$ and $y$, respectively.

# 🎯Intent
The biggest reason is that <u>it reminds us what the input variable is</u>. The derivative is measuring the instantaneous rate of change of the output variable of a function with respect to the input variable. Sometimes, if there are lots of quantities that have variables representing them, it's easy to lose track of what is what; Leibniz notation helps to remind us.

# 🧪Composition
There are few common properties of Leibniz notation.
- Units:
    - If $P$ has units of pressure, and $t$ has units of <u>time</u>, then the following has units of pressure per time.
    - $$
      \frac{dP}{dt}
      $$
    
- Evaluating at points
    - If we want to take the derivative at a particular point $x=3$, then we use the following notation. The bar is read as **“evaluated at"**.
    - $$
      \frac{df}{dx}\Bigg|_{x=3}
      $$
    
- Derivatives act on functions
    - If a formula is long, we can write:
    - $$
      \frac{d}{dy}(y^3+2y^2)
      $$
    
# 🧮Expression
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{df}{dx}
\end{align}
