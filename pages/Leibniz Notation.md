- # 🍴Quick Digest -> Leibniz Notation
	- ## 📝Definition
	  Leibniz notation uses the symbols $dx$ and $dy$ to represent infinitely small (or infinitesimal) increments of $x$ and $y$, respectively, just as $Δx$ and $Δy$ represent finite increments of $x$ and $y$, respectively.
	- ## 🎯Intent
	  The biggest reason is that <u>it reminds us what the input variable is</u>. The derivative is measuring the instantaneous rate of change of the output variable of a function with respect to the input variable. Sometimes, if there are lots of quantities that have variables representing them, it's easy to lose track of what is what; Leibniz notation helps to remind us.
	- ## 🧪Composition
	  There are few common properties of Leibniz notation.
		- Units:
			- If $P$ has units of pressure, and $t$ has units of <u>time</u>, then the following has units of pressure per time.
			- $$
			  \frac{dP}{dt}
			  $$
		- Evaluating at points
			- If we want to take the derivative at a particular point $x=3$, then we use the following notation. The bar is read as **“evaluated at"**.
			- $$
			  \frac{df}{dx}\Bigg|_{x=3}
			  $$
		- Derivatives act on functions
			- If a formula is long, we can write:
			- $$
			  \frac{d}{dy}(y^3+2y^2)
			  $$
