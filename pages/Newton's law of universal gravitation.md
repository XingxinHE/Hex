# 📝Description
Newton's law of universal gravitation states that every point mass attracts every single other point mass by a force pointing along the line intersecting both points. The force is directly proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the point masses.

# ✒Equation
$$
\begin{align}
F=\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}
\end{align}
$$
where:
-   $F$ is the force between the masses;
-   $G$ is the [gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant "Gravitational constant") ($6.674\times10^{−11} m^3\cdot kg^{−1}\cdot s^{−2}$);
-   $m_1$ is the first mass;
-   $m_2$ is the second mass;
-   $r$ is the distance between the [[centroid|center of mass]].

# 🕳Pitfalls / Cons
Valid only in the nonrelativistic limit (speeds much less than the speed of light and small gravitational fields).
