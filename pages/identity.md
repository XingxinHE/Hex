# 📝Definition
An identity is a mathematical relationship equating one quantity to another (which may initially appear to be different).

In #SetTheory , the equality symbol $=$ means *logical identity*.
e.g.
- When we write $a=b$, we mean that "$a$" and "$b$" are symbols for the same object.
- When we write $A=B$, we mean that "$A$" and "$B$" are the symbols for the same set.
