# 📝Definition
If two numbers $b$ and $c$ have the property that their difference $b-c$ is integrally divisible by a number $m$ (i.e., $(b-c)/m$ is an [[integer]]), then $b$ and $c$ are said to be "congruent modulo $m$."

# ✒Notation
The statement "$b$ is congruent to $c$ (modulo $m$)" is written as:
$$
b\equiv c(\mod m)
$$
where
- $m$ is called the [[modulus]]
