# 📝Definition
The study of the geometry of figures by algebraic representation and manipulation of equations describing their positions, configurations, and separations.

Analytic geometry is also called coordinate geometry since the objects are described as $n$-[[Tuple]]s of points (where $n=2$ in the plane and $n=3$ in space) in some [[coordinate system]].
