# 📝Definition
$\alpha$ is called a plane curve if there exists a [[plane]] $P\subset\mathbb{R}^3$, s.t. the [[range|image]] of $\alpha$ is contained in $P$. Denoted as:
$$
\alpha(I)\subset P
$$
where $I$ is an open interval in the [[smooth curve#📝Definition]].

> [!info] Remark
> A plane curve can be always transformed by a rigid motion to $P=\{z=0\}$ and its parameterized equation can be simplified as $\alpha(t)=(x(t), y(t), 0)$.
