# 📝Definition
The term "isomorphic" means "**having the same form**" and is used in many branches of mathematics to identify mathematical objects which **have the same structural properties**.

Objects which may be represented (or "embedded") differently but which have the same essential structure are often said to be "identical up to an isomorphism."

# 🧠Intuition
the Hindu-Arabic number system $\{0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\}$ and the Roman number system $\{O, I, II, III, IV,V,V I, \dots\}$, are isomorphic, because they have a one-to-one correspondence $0 \leftrightarrow O, 1 \leftrightarrow I, 2 \leftrightarrow II$, etc.

# ✒Notation
The statement "$A$ is isomorphic to $B$" is denoted
$$
\begin{align}
A\cong B
\end{align}
$$

# 🌓Complement
[[nonisomorphic]]

# 🗃Example
Example is the most straightforward way to understand a mathematical concept.
