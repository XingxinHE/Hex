# 📖Terminology
> [!warning]
> A warning about terminology. Many people use the term “infinitely differentiable” for functions which have derivatives of all orders and reserve the word “differentiable” to mean that only the existence of the first derivative is required. **We shall not follow this usage**.


# 📝Definition
Differential geometry is a mathematical discipline that studies the geometry of smooth shapes and smooth spaces, otherwise known as smooth manifolds or [[Riemannian Manifold]]. It uses the techniques of differential calculus, integral calculus, linear algebra and multilinear algebra.

# 🧠Intuition
- Differential geometry deals with metrical notions on [[manifold]]s.

# 🧪Composition
The differential geometry of curves and surfaces has two aspects.
## 🧫classical differential geometry
### 📝Description
The study of ==local== properties of [[smooth curve]]s and [[surface]]s. By local properties we mean those properties which depend only on the behavior of the curve or surface in the neighborhood of a point.

> [!info] Remark
> the most interesting and representative part of classical differential geometry is the study of surfaces.

## ⚗global differential geometry
### 📝Description
Study the influence of the local properties on the behavior of the ==entire== curve or surface.
