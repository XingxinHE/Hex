	- ## 📝Definition
	  Differential geometry is a mathematical discipline that studies the geometry of smooth shapes and smooth spaces, otherwise known as smooth manifolds or [[Riemannian Manifold]]. It uses the techniques of differential calculus, integral calculus, linear algebra and multilinear algebra.
	- ## 🧠Intuition
	  Differential geometry deals with metrical notions on [[manifold]]s.
	- ## 🧮Expression
	  $$
	  \begin{align}
	  f(x)&=
