- Don't repeat yourself.

- when we need to solve a problem, we look for a similar problem and use our solution for that with suitable modification. Donâ€™t start from scratch unless you really have to. Using a previous version of a program as a base for modification often saves a lot of time, and we benefit from much of the effort that went into the original program.
