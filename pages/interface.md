# 📝Definition
The term "interface" differs in different programming language.
- More General
    - The set of operations supported by a [[data structure]] is called an **interface**.
    - A declaration or a set of declarations specifying how a piece of code (such as a function or a class) can be called.
- For C++
    - An interface describes the behavior or capabilities of a C++ class without committing to a particular implementation of that class.
- For C# and Java
    - An interface defines a contract. Any class or struct that implements that contract must provide an implementation of the members defined in the interface.

# 🧠Intuition
Since the definition differs, here as well.
- For #csharp  and #Java
    - Interface is a language element.
    
- For #cpp ,
    - Interface is a concept and it is very close to the General Concept.
    
# 🗃Example
Example is the most straightforward way to understand a concept.
- In C#,
    - `List<T>` has the interface `Add()`.
    - `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` has the interface `Add()`.
    - They are with **same** semantics but their logic behind are highly **different**.⚠
    
- In C++,
    - `std::vector` has the interface `begin()`
    - `std::deque` has the interface `begin()`
    - They are with **same** semantics but their logic behind are highly **different**.⚠
