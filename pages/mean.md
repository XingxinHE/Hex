# üìùDefinition
There are several statistical quantities called means.
| mean                      | value                                  | abbreviations |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| harmonic mean             | $\frac{2ab}{a+b}$                      | H             |
| geometric mean            | $\sqrt{ab}$                            | G             |
| arithmetic-geometric mean | $\frac{(a+b)\pi}{4K(\frac{a-b}{a+b})}$ | AGM           |
| arithmetic mean           | $\frac{a+b}{2}$                        | A             |
| root-mean-square          | $\sqrt{\frac{a^2+b^2}{2}}$             | RMS           |

When applied to two elements $a$ and $b$ with $0<a\leq b$, these means satisfy
$$
H(a,b)\leq G(a,b)\leq AGM(a,b)\leq A(a,b)\leq RMS(a,b)
$$
> [!NOTE]
> Normally, we refer arithmetic mean as [[average]].

## [[mean]], [[median]], [[mode]]
The comparison is the following.
