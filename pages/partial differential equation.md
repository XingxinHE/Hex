# 📝Definition
A *partial differential equation*(**PDE**) is an equation involving functions and their [[partial derivative]]s.

# ✒Notation
An expression of the form
$$
\begin{align}
F(D^k u(x),D^{k-1}u(x),\dots,Du(x),u(x),x)=0\quad(x\in U)
\end{align}
$$
is called a $k^{\text{th}}$-order partial differential equation, where
$$
F:\mathbb{R}^{n^k}\times\mathbb{R}^{n^{k-1}}\times\cdots\times\mathbb{R}^{n}\times\mathbb{R}\times U\to\mathbb{R}
$$
is given, and 
$$
u:U\to\mathbb{R}
$$
is the unknown.
