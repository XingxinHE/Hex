# 📝Definition
Poisson's equation is a second-order [[partial differential equation]] arising in #physics .

# ✒Notation
There are many forms of Poisson's equations.
$$
\begin{align}
\Delta \varphi &=f\\
\nabla ^{2}\varphi &=f\\
\nabla ^{2}\psi &=4\pi\rho\\
\nabla ^{2}\Phi &=\sigma(\mathbf{x})\\
\end{align}
$$
But they are all the same.
- $\Delta$ is the [[Laplace operator]]
- the right hand side are real or complex-valued functions on a [[manifold]]
	- $f$
	- $4\pi\rho$
	- $\sigma(\mathbf{x})$
- the greek symbols on left hand side are also real or complex-valued functions on a manifold
- $\nabla ^{2}$ is equivalent to $\Delta$ when the manifold is Euclidean space.
