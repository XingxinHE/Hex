# 📝Definition
This is obtained from the general equation of a [[plane]]
$$
ax+by+cz+d=0 \tag{1}
$$
by defining the components of the unit [[normal vector]] $\hat{\mathbf{n}}=(n_x,n_y,n_z)$,
$$
\begin{align}
n_\textcolor{red}{x}	&=\frac{\textcolor{red}a}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}}\\
n_\textcolor{green}{y}	&=\frac{\textcolor{green}b}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}}\\
n_\textcolor{blue}{z}	&=\frac{\textcolor{blue}c}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}}\\
\end{align} \tag{2}
$$
and the constant $p$ is the distance from the plane to the origin
$$
p=\frac{d}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}}.  \tag{3}
$$
Then the **Hessian normal form** of the plane is
$$
\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\mathbf{r}=-p, \tag{4}
$$
where $\mathbf{r}$ is a [[position vector]] from the origin of the coordinate system $O$, to any point $P$ that lies precisely in plane.

> [!info] Remark
>  The sign of $p$ in $(3)$ determines the side of the plane on which the origin is located.
>  - If $p>0$, it is in the half-space determined by the direction of $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$.
>  - If $p<0$, it is in the other [[half-space]].
