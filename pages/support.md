# 📝Definition
In mathematics, the support of a [[real-valued function]] $f$ is the subset of the function domain containing the elements which are not mapped to zero. If the domain of $f$ is a topological space, then the support of $f$ is instead defined as the smallest closed set containing all points not mapped to zero. This concept is used very widely in mathematical analysis.
