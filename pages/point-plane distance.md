# 📝Definition
The point-plane distance from a point $\mathbf{x}_0$ to a plane in [[Hessian normal form]] is given by the simple equation
$$
D=\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\mathbf{x}_0+p.
$$
> [!info] Remark
> - If the point $\mathbf{x}_0$ is in the [[half-space]] determined by the direction of $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$, then $D>0$.
> - If it is in the other half-space, then $D<0$.
