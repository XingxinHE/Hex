- ## Quick Digest -> Inflection Point
	- ### 📝Definition
	  An inflection point is a point where the concavity of the function changes. That is the [[second derivative]] changes sign — $f''(x)>0$ just to the left of $x$ and $f''(x)<0$ just to the right of $x$ (or vice versa).

		- TODO  this is a good candidate illustrate $y''=0$ not 100% inflection point. also consider the "just to the right/left". $y = x^4 -4x +1$
