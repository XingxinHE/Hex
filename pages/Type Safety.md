- # 😎Quick Digest -> Type Safety
	- ## 📝Definition
	  A program — or a part of a program — is type-safe when [[object]]s are used only **according to the rules** for their [[type]].
	- ## 🎯Intent
	   A short description what does this thing do?
	- ## 🧠Intuition
	  Complete type safety is the ideal and therefore the general rule for the language. Keep an eye on the literal - "ideal". Therefore this is the rule in daily practice. For technical details. You should refer to [[type conversion]].
	- ## 🚀Benefit
	   A scenario that illustrates the benefit this object provides.
	- ## ⌨Sample Code
	   Code fragments
