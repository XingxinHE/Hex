# 📝Definition
Let $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ be [[scalar]]s not all equal to $0$. Then the [[set]] $S$ consisting of all [[vector]]s 
$$
\mathbf{X} =
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1\\ x_2\\\vdots\\ x_n
\end{bmatrix}
$$
in $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that
$$
a_1x_1+a_2x_2+...+a_nx_n=c 
$$
for $c$ a constant is a [[subspace]] of $\mathbb{R}^n$ called a hyperplane.
