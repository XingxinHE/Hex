# ‚è∞History
In the old days, programmers make a GLOBAL variable. When the method is called, the program is asked to check the GLOBAL variable to see if it is successful. The classic example is the `return` value of C++.
```cpp
int main()
{
	return 0; //this is success return.
}
```

# üìùDefinition
Different language has their own mechanism when encountering errors.
- #csharp  , they use the [[Exception]]  to handle errors in a more robust way, e.g.[[try-catch]].
- #cpp , they use [[Exception]] to handle errors in modern c++, e.g. [[try-catch]].
