	- Learning involves repetition.
	- the exercises focus on the practical aspects of programming, whereas the review questions try to help you articulate the ideas and concepts.
	- ⭐You could memorize all of C++’s built-in types and all the rules for their use. Of course you could, and doing so might make you feel knowledgeable. However, **it would not make you a programmer**.
	- ⭐⭐⭐You need to understand the reasons behind those ideals to understand why they should be your ideals, why aiming for them will help you and the users of your code. Nobody should be satisfied with “because that’s the way it is” as an explanation. More importantly, an understanding of ideals and reasons allows you to generalize from what you know to new situations and to combine ideas and tools in novel ways to address new problems. Knowing “why” is an essential part of acquiring programming skills. Conversely, **just memorizing lots of poorly understood rules and language facilities is limiting**, a source of errors, and a massive waste of time. We consider your time precious and try not to waste it.
	- We encourage you to become a good programmer, with **a broad view** of what it takes to produce good software.
	- please don’t forget:
	  • Our primary study is programming.
	  • Our output is programs/systems.
	  • A programming language is (only) a tool.
