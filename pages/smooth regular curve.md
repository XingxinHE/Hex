# 📝Definition
**📄Definition**
A parametrized [[smooth curve|differentiable curve]] $\alpha: I \to \mathbb{R}^3$ is said to be ==regular== if $\alpha'(t) \neq 0$ for all $t \in I$.
___
**📑Definition**
Let $\alpha : I \to\mathbb{R}^n$ be a smooth parameterized curve. The [[derivative]] $\alpha' (t)$ is called [[velocity vector]] at $t$. The map $\alpha$ is called ==regular== if and only if its velocity vector never vanishes.

# 🧠Intuition
A regular curve does not have any [[singularity|singular point]].

# 🗃Example
Example is the most straightforward way to understand a mathematical concept.
