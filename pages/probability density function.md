# 📝Definition
A probability distribution or a probability density function is defined as a nonnegative function $p(x)$ defined on $-\infty < x < \infty$ with the property that
$$
\int _{-\infty }^{\infty } p(x)\,  dx =1
$$
In this case, the probability of the outcome $a<x<b$ is defined as:
$$
P(a < x < b)=\int _a^b p(x)\, dx.
$$
