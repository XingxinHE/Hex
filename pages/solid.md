# 📝Definition
A closed three-dimensional figure (which may, according to some terminology conventions, be self-intersecting). Kern and Bland (1948, p. 18) define a solid as any limited portion of space bounded by surfaces. Among the simplest solids are the sphere, cube, cone, cylinder, and more generally, the polyhedra.
