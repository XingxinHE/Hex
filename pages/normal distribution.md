# 📝Definition
The normal distribution is
$$
p(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi }} e^{\frac{-(x-\mu )^2}{2\sigma ^2}}
$$
The interpretation on the symbols are different.
- $\mu$ - [[mean|expected value]], [[mean]]
- [ ] $x$ - [[Glossary#variate|variate]]
- $\sigma$ - [[standard deviation]]
- $\sigma^2$ - [[variance]]

# 🎯Intent
The normal distribution is used to compute probabilities across all sciences, social sciences, and engineering, for example in measurements in #astronomy, #biology , #chemistry , or #physics  . You may have seen it used for grades on an exam, or with respect to heights or weights of people in a population.
