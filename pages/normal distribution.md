# 📝Definition
The normal distribution is
$$
p(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi }} e^{\frac{-(x-\mu )^2}{2\sigma ^2}}
$$
The interpretation on the symbols are different.
- $\mu$ - [[mean|expected value]], [[mean]]
- $x$ - [[Glossary#variate|variate]]
- $\sigma$ - [[standard deviation]]
- $\sigma^2$ - [[variance]]

# 🎯Intent
The normal distribution is used to compute probabilities across all sciences, social sciences, and engineering, for example in measurements in #astronomy, #biology , #chemistry , or #physics  . You may have seen it used for grades on an exam, or with respect to heights or weights of people in a population.

# 🗃Example
- 📌normal distribution
	- 💬Question:
		- Jen had an algebra class at university where each question was True-or-False. If you got a question correct, you got $+1$ point. If you got a question wrong, you got $-1$ point. There were $100$ questions. The distribution of exam scores was normal and given by the normal distribution.
		- $$\frac{1}{30\sqrt{2\pi }} e^{-x^2/1800}.$$
		- If the probability that a student gets a score of 30 points or higher is $0.16$, what is the probability that a student scores between -30 and 0 points?
	- 🏹Strategy:
		- The question seems complicated at the first glance. while it is super easy! We must remember that a normal distribution is [[Function#^49e41254c30b3ba8|even function]].
	- ✏Solution:
		- Draw the diagram
			- ![name|200](../assets/normal_distribution.svg)
			- Therefore the probability is $1\cdot\frac{1}{2}-0.16=0.32$
