# 🗺Big Picture
The exact mathematical model of a surface is usually intractable. Therefore, the word "surface" is smooth and it is only smooth in the world of #mathematics but not the real world! Because in the real world, everything is discrete! This is the philosophy and this is when [[discrete differential geometry|DDG]] steps in.

# 📝Definition
- In general,
	- 📝Definition
		- The word "surface" can be used to denote an $(n-1)$-dimensional submanifold of an $n$-dimensional [[manifold]] .
		
- In most common sense in #mathematics ,
	- 📝Definition
		- The most common and straightforward use of the word is to denote a two-dimensional [submanifold](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Submanifold.html) of three-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/EuclideanSpace.html).
		
- In #[[Computer Graphics]],
	- 📝Definition⭐
		- The common definition of a *surface* in the context of computer graphics application is "an [[simplicial complex#🌈Properties#🔴Orientation|orientable]] [[continuity|continuous]] 2D [[manifold]] embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
            
# ⛈Characteristics / Properties
## Smoothness
### 📝Definition
- Smoothness is measured by the number $k$ of [[continuity|continuous]] [[derivative]]s that the function have.
- 👑Importance
	- A surface SHOULD be smooth in general, except for a well-defined set of sharp feature-(curves, )
- > ==**Note⚠**==: This analytical definition of $C^k$ smoothness coincides with the intuitive geometrical understanding of smoothness only if the [[partial derivative]]s and the [[gradient]] do not vanish locally(regularity).
## Fairness
### 📝Definition
- This is the stricter requirement for surface, where not only the [[continuity]] of the [[derivative]]s but also their magnitude and variation is considered. No general definition of this properties but *a surface is fair* if the [[curvature]] or its variation is globally minimized.
### 📈Diagram

  Three examples of fair surfaces, which define a blend between two cylinders:
	- *left*: a membrane surface that minimizes the surface area,
	- *center*: a thin-plate surface that minimizes total curvature,
	- *right*: a surface that minimizes the variation of mean curvature

# 🏷(Sub)Categories
[[sphere]], [[plane]], [[cylindrical surface]]

## Surface categorized via [[curvature]]
- [[developable surface]]

# 💫Operation
> ==**Note⚠**==: Different representation has their own advantage on this.
## Evaluation
- This entails the [[sampling]] of the surface geometry or of other surface attributes, e.g., the surface normal field. A typical application example is surface [[rendering]].
	
## Query
- Spatial queries are used to determine whether or not a given point $p\in\mathbb{R}^3$ is inside or outside of the solid bounded by a surface $S$, which is a key component for solid [[modeling]] operations. Another typical query is the computation of a point's distance to a surface.
	
## Modification
A surface can be modified either in terms of geometry or in terms of topology.
- The modification on **geometry** means the surface deformation.
- The modification on **topology** means the different parts of the surface are to be merged, cut, or deleted.
        
# 📏Surface Approximation
## 📋Prerequisite
- For more complex shapes, a single function is not enough to define a surface.
- A digital surface representation can only be an ==approximation== in general.
- > ==**Note⚠**==: whether you like it or not, approximation is **mandatory**.
## 📝Definition
- To solve the constraint of "a single function can't define a surface accurately", the function domain is usually split into smaller sub-regions and an individual function(surface patch) is defined for each segment. That's where approximation comes in.
	- For parametric representation, the "surface patch" is [[triangle mesh]] / polygon mesh.
	- For implicit representation, the "surface patch" is hexahedral [[voxel]]s or tetrahedral cells.
- > ==**Note⚠**==: In this piecewise definition, each function needs to approximate the given shape only **locally**, while the **global** approximation tolerance is controlled by the size and number of segments.
## 🚿Common source of surface
- The raw information about the input surface is obtained by **discrete** [[sampling]] (i.e., by evaluation if there already exists a digital representation, or by probing if the input comes from a real object).
## 🏹Strategy
- 1️⃣Generate a mathematical surface representation by establishing [[continuity]] to guarantee a consistent transition from each patch to its neighboring ones.
- 2️⃣Restrict functions to the class of [[polynomial]]s.
	- (1/2 benefits) polynomial can be evaluated by elementary arithmetic operation
	- (2/2) the [[Karl Weierstrass#Weierstrass Approximation Theorem|Weierstrass Approximation Theorem]] guarantees that each smooth([[differentiable]]) function can be approximated by a polynomial up to desired precision.
- 3️⃣Improve the accuracy of an approximation with piecewise polynomial.
	- Methods
		- method 1 *p-refinement*: raise the degree of the polynomial.
			- 🕳**Cons**
				- Can't make reasonable assumptions about the boundedness of higher-order [[derivative]]s since our input is discretely sampled.
				- the $C^k$ smoothness condition between segments is hard to satisfy in higher order piece-wise function.
		- method 2 *h-refinement*: reduce the size of the individual segments and use more segments. (preferred in [[Geometry Processing]]👍)
			- 🚀**Pros**
				- With today's computer architecture([[GPU]], [[parallel computing]]), processing a large number of very simple objects is often more efficient than processing a smaller number of more complex ones.
				- > ==**Note⚠**==: That's why choice of $C^0$ piecewise linear surface representation, i.e. [[triangle mesh]] have become the widely established standard in geometry processing!!

# 🎨Surface Representation
## 🔭Overview
From a high level point of view, there are 2 major classes of surface representations:
- [[parametric surface representation]]
- [[implicit surface representation]]
## 🎯Intent
Why does representation matter? For each specific problem in [[Geometry Processing]], we can identify a characteristic set of operations by which the computation is dominated, and hence we have to choose an appropriate representation that supports the efficient implementation of these operation.
	
## 🌓Comparison
> [!NOTE] Note
> Both parametric and implicit representation have their particular strengths and weakness, such that for each geometric problem the better suited one should be chosen.
