The art of expressing solutions to problems as code.

- 
- Programming is an intellectually challenging set of skills that are part of many important and interesting technical disciplines.

- Programming is a way of presenting ideas in code ‚Äî a way of aiding problem solving.

- Programming is a tool; it is a fundamental tool for expressing solutions to fundamental and practical problems so that they can be tested, improved through experiment, and used.

- Programming is where ideas and theories meet reality.

- the idea that ‚Äúprogramming is understanding‚Äù: when you can program a task, you understand it. Conversely, when you understand a task thoroughly, you can write a program to do it. In other words, we can see programming as part of an effort to thoroughly understand a topic. A program is a precise representation of our understanding of a topic.

- ‚Ä¢ Analysis: What‚Äôs the problem? What does the user want? What does the
  user need? What can the user afford? What kind of reliability do we need?
  ‚Ä¢ Design: How do we solve the problem? What should be the overall structure
  of the system? Which parts does it consist of? How do those parts
  communicate with each other? How does the system communicate with
  its users?
  ‚Ä¢ Programming: Express the solution to the problem (the design) in code.
  Write the code in a way that meets all constraints (time, space, money, reliability,
  and so on). Make sure that the code is correct and maintainable.
  ‚Ä¢ Testing: Make sure the system works correctly under all circumstances
  required by systematically trying it out.

- Programming plus testing is often called implementation.

- The crucial concept here is feedback. We learn from experience and modify our behavior based on what we learn. That‚Äôs essential for effective software development.

- Direct expression of ideas in code is a fundamental ideal of programming.
