# 📝Definition
In mathematics, we use $n\mathbin{++}$ to denote the increment operation or [[successor]] of $n$.
e.g.
$$
\begin{align}
3\mathbin{++}&= 4\\  4\mathbb{++}&=5
\end{align}
$$

In computer science, the $n\mathbin{++}$ actually redefines the value of $n$ to be its successor.
e.g.
```cpp
int num = 10;
num++;  //num is already 11
```

> [!tip]
> In mathematics, we ==**avoid**== defining a variable more than once in any given setting, as it can often lead to confusion.
