# üìùDefinition and Classification
- A `constexpr` symbolic constant must be given a value that is known at [[compile-time]].

# üß†Intuition
`constexpr` is "conster" than [[const]].

# üöÄBenefit
 Help [[run-time]] computation into [[compile-time]] computation which let software run faster.

# ‚å®Sample Code
- On Initialization
  
  ``` c++
  int n = 42;
  constexpr int max = n; //‚ùåERROR. non-constant initializer
  constexpr int min = 2; //‚úÖOK. constant init
  ```

# üè∑(Sub)Categories
With `constexpr` keyword, there are few products.
- `constexpr` function. A function which will be evaluated in compile-time and to avoid having the same calculation done millions of times at run time.
- `constexpr` variable

# ‚å®Sample Code
- example of `constexpr` function
    - Suppose you have the function
      
      ``` c++
      constexpr double xscale = 10; // scaling factors
      constexpr double yscale = 0.8;
      
      //‚úãthe function
      constexpr Point scale(Point p) { return {xscale*p.x,yscale*p.y}; };
      ```
    - How you use it.
      
      ``` c++
      void user(Point p1)
      {
          Point p2 {10,10};
          Point p3 = scale(p1); // ‚úÖOK: p3 == {100,8}; `p3` is not declared with `constexpr` and its run-time evaluation is fine
          constexpr Point p4 = scale(p2); // ‚úÖOK. p4 == {100,8}.  `p4` is declared with `constexpr` and its calculation can all be handled in compile-time
          constexpr Point p5 = scale(p1); // ‚ùåerror: scale (p1) is not a constant and not with const expression
          // expression
          constexpr Point p6 = scale(p2); // ‚úÖOK. p6 == {100,8} same with p4
          // . . .
      }
      ```
