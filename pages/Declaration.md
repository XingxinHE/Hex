# üìùDefinition and Classification
A declaration tells compilers about the name and type of something but it **omits** some details.

# ‚å®Sample Code
- On different categories of declarations:
  
  ``` c++
  extern int x;		// object declaration
  
  std::size_t numDigits(int number);		//function declaration
  
  class Widget;		//class declaration
  
  template<typename T>
  class GraphNode;		//template declaration
  ```
- example of declaration specifiers and declarator
  
  ``` c++
  static unsigned long int            *x[N];
  /* declaration specifiers */    /* declarator */   /* x is declarator-id */
  ```

# üåìComplement
What is the complement of this subject? e.g. vector-covector, constructor-destructor
- üìåRelationship between Declaration and [[Definition]] ^72ee5fd56e669cbb
    - All definitions are declarations.
    - Not all declarations are definitions.

# üß™Composition
The declaration expression can be divided as 2 parts:
- a sequence of declaration specifiers ^a2d92b11b418fa2c
- a declarator ^72beabf6871adb42
    - declarator-id
    
# üè∑(Sub)Categories
- By Scott Meyer, The declaration can be subdivided into:
    - object declaration
    - function declaration
    - class declaration
    - template declaration
    
- By Bjarne, the declaration can be subdivided into
    - Variables
    - Constants
    - Functions (see ¬ß8.5)
    - Namespaces (see ¬ß8.7)
    - Types (classes and enumerations; see Chapter 9)
    - Templates (see Chapter 19)

- Declaration Specifiers
    - It can be categorized as:
        - type specifier
            - e.g. `int`, `long`, `double`, `string`, `vector<int>`
            
        - non-type specifier
            - e.g. `extern`, `static`, `virtual`

- Declarator Operator
    - | Precedence | Operator | Meaning |
      | ---- | ---- | ---- |
      | Highest | () | grouping |
      | Medium | [] | array |
      | Medium | () | function |
      | Lowest | unary * | pointer |
      | Lowest | unary & | lvalue reference |
      | Lowest | unary && | rvalue reference |
    - Quiz - what is `*x[N]` ?
        - A. `x` is "a pointer to an array".
        - B. `x` is "an array of pointers".
        - We chose B. Because `[]` has higher precedence than unary `*`.  (Tips: try to read from top to the bottom)

- Parentheses in Declarators
    - It has 2 roles:
        - [[function call operator]]
            - these `()` follow the declarator-id
            
        - grouping
            - these `()` enclose the declarator-id
            
    - example on different uses of parentheses
      
      ``` c++
      // function call operator example
      *f(int);
      /* f is a function with parameter of type int returning poitner */
      
      // grouping example
      (*f)(int);
      /* This becomes a pointer to function. */
      ```

- `const` is a type-specifier
    - The order of the declaration specifiers doesn't matter to the compilers.
    - example of order doesn't matter
      
      ``` c++
      const unsigned long cul;
      unsigned const long cul;
      long unsigned const cul;
      ```
    - once you understand the rule, you can easily notify which is right or wrong?
