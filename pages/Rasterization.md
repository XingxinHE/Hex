- 📝Definition
	- The rasterization pipeline
- 🧠Intuition
	- for each primitive (e.g., triangle), which pixels light up?
- 🚀Benefit / Pros
	- extremely fast (BILLIONS of triangles per second on GPU)
- 🕳Pitfalls / Cons
	- harder (but not impossible) to achieve photorealism
- 🤳Applicability
	- perfect match for 2D vector art, fonts, quick 3D preview, …
- 🌓Complement
	- Rasterization vs. Ray Tracing
