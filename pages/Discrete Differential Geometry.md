# ðŸ§ Intuition
DDG translate [[differential geometry]] into language suitable for **computation**.

# ðŸ§€Applicability
There are few application of Discrete Differential Geometry:
- Geometry Processing
- Shape Analysis
- Machine Learning
- Numerical Simulation
- Architecture&Design
- Discrete Models of Nature
- In a nutshell, **GEOMETRY IS EVERYWHERE**!
