alias:: prime

- # 📝Definition
	- A prime is an integer $p$, greater than one, which has no factors other than itself and one.
- # 👑Importance
	- The importance of the class of primes is due to the fact that **every integer can be expressed as a product of primes**: if a number is not itself a prime, it may be successively factored until all the factors are primes;
