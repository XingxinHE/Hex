# 📝Definition
Given a [[probability density function|probability distribution]] $p(x)$ with
$$
\int _{-\infty }^{\infty } p(x)\,  dx =1
$$
and whose [[mean|expected value]] is $E$, the ==variance==, V, measures the average spread of outcomes from the expected value.
$$
\text{Variance}= V = \int _{-\infty }^{\infty } (x-E)^2 p(x)\, dx.
$$
The [[standard deviation]], $\sigma$, is the square root of the variance:
$$
\sigma = \sqrt{V}.
