# 📝Definition
An ellipse is a curve that is the [[locus]] of all points in the plane the sum of whose distances $r_1$ and $r_2$ from two fixed points $F_1$ and $F_2$ (the foci) separated by a distance of $2c$ is a given positive constant $2a$. This results in the two-center bipolar coordinate equation
$$
r_1+r_2=2a, 
$$
where $a$ is the semimajor axis and the origin of the coordinate system is at one of the foci.
