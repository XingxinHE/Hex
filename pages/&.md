- # 😎Quick Digest -> `&`
	- ## 📝Definition
	  The name is the essence of this topic.
		- In computer science, the asterisk is commonly used as a wildcard character, or to denote pointers, repetition, or multiplication.

		- In C++, there are few meaning using `&` symbol.
			- Address-of operator: `&`
			- Bitwise AND operator: `&`
			- Logical AND operator: `&&`
			- [[lvalue]] reference declarator: `&`
			- [[rvalue]] reference declarator: `&&`

	   Code fragments
		- In C++,
			- example using `&` as address-of operator pass to a pointer
			  
			  ``` c++
			  //The `&` in front of a variable is to take its address.
			  int num = 10;
			  int *ptr = &num;
			  ```
			- example: Address of a reference type
			  
			  ``` c++
			  double d;        // Define an object of type double.
			  double &rd = d;  // Define a reference to the object.
			  
			  // Obtain and compare their addresses
			  if( &d == &rd )
			    cout << "&d equals &rd" << endl;
			  ```
			- example - demonstrate bitwise AND
			  
			  ``` c++
			     unsigned short a = 0xCCCC;      // pattern 1100 ...
			     unsigned short b = 0xAAAA;      // pattern 1010 ...
			  
			     cout  << hex << ( a & b ) << endl;   // prints "8888", pattern 1000 ...
			  ```
			- example - use `&` to [[pass-by-reference]]
			  
			  ``` c++
			  // pass by reference
			  void IncrementA(int &num)
			  {
			      num++;
			  }
			  // pass by value
			  void IncrementB(int num)
			  {
			      num++;
			  }
			  ```
			  The `&` in front of a parameter is to indicate that modifying the original. Apparently, the  `IncrementA` does increment the number because it modifies the origin by using `&`. But `IncrementB` does not.
