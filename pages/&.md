alias:: ampersand

- ## 📝Definition
	- In computer science, the asterisk is commonly used as a wildcard character, or to denote pointers, repetition, or multiplication.
- ## 🏷(Sub)Categories
	- In C++, there are few meaning using `&` symbol.
		- Address-of operator: `&`
		- Bitwise AND operator: `&`
		- Logical AND operator: `&&`
		- [[lvalue]] reference declarator: `&`
		- [[rvalue]] reference declarator: `&&`
- ## ⌨Sample Code
	- In C++,
		- example using `&` as address-of operator pass to a pointer
		  
		  ``` c++
		  //The `&` in front of a variable is to take its address.
		  int num = 10;
		  int *ptr = &num;
		  ```
		- example: Address of a reference type
		  
		  ``` c++
		  double d;        // Define an object of type double.
		  double &rd = d;  // Define a reference to the object.
		  
		  // Obtain and compare their addresses
		  if( &d == &rd )
		    cout << "&d equals &rd" << endl;
		  ```
		- example - demonstrate bitwise AND
		  
		  ``` c++
		     unsigned short a = 0xCCCC;      // pattern 1100 ...
		     unsigned short b = 0xAAAA;      // pattern 1010 ...
		  
		     cout  << hex << ( a & b ) << endl;   // prints "8888", pattern 1000 ...
		  ```
		- example - use `&` to [[pass-by-reference]]
		  
		  ``` c++
		  // pass by reference
		  void IncrementA(int &num)
		  {
		      num++;
		  }
		  // pass by value
		  void IncrementB(int num)
		  {
		      num++;
		  }
		  ```
		  The `&` in front of a parameter is to indicate that modifying the original. Apparently, the  `IncrementA` does increment the number because it modifies the origin by using `&`. But `IncrementB` does not.
