# 📝Definition

Numerical integration is the approximate computation of an integral(especially [[definite integral]]) using numerical techniques.

# 👑Importance
Many integrals don't have formulas and therefore we can't apply [[First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus|FTC1]]. And numerical integration is the key!


# 🎯Intent
Compute them with a calculator or a machine.
