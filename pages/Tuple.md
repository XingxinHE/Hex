alias:: sequence

- # 📝Definition
	- A **sequence** of objects is a list of these objects in some order.
	- Sequences maintain a collection of items in an **[extrinsic](((632c48d7-14a7-454c-9177-d0ce541aae76)))** order, where each item stored has **a rank in the sequence**, including a first item and a last item.
	- **Finite** sequences often are called **tuples**.
