# 📝Definition
- A **sequence** of objects is a list of these objects in some order.
- Elements that can be visited in a linear order.
- Sequences maintain a collection of items in an **[[Glossary#extrinsic|extrinsic]]** order, where each item stored has **a rank in the sequence**, including a first item and a last item.
**Finite** sequences often are called **tuples**.

# ⛈Characteristics / Properties
- 📌Order
    - The order doesn’t matter in a [[set]] , but in a sequence and tuple it does.
    - $$
      (7,21,57)\neq(57,7,21)
      $$
