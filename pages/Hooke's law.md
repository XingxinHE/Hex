# 📝Description
Hooke's law of elasticity is the law in #physics which states that the extension of a spring is directly **proportional** to the force applied.
# ✒Equation
$$
\begin{align}
F=-kx
\end{align}
$$
# 🧠Intuition
Strain is directly proportional to stress.

# 🕳Cons
Applies to linear-elastic materials for forces that do not exceed the elastic limit.
