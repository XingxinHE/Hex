# 📝Definition
**📄Definition - smooth curve**
A smooth curve is a [[curve]] which is a smooth function, where the word "curve" is interpreted in the #AnalyticGeometry  context. In particular, a smooth curve is a [[continuity|continuous]] [[function|mapping]] $f$ from a $1$-dimensional space to an $n$-dimensional space which on its [[domain]] has continuous [[derivative]]s up to a desired order.

**📃Definition - differentiable curve**
A parametrized differentiable curve is a [[differentiable]] [[Function|map]] $\alpha: I \to \mathbb{R}^3$ of an open [[interval]] $I = (a, b)$ of the real line $\mathbb{R}$ into $\mathbb{R}^3$.


> [!info] Remark
> When discussing curves from the standpoint of analytic geometry, care must be exhibited to maintain the important distinction between the curve itself and its [[range|image]] within its [[codomain]].

> These 2 are unique as curves even though both functions have the [[interval]] $[0,1]$ as their image in $\mathbb{R}$. This distinction is especially important due the fact that unique curves may possess drastically different geometric behavior in terms of self-intersection, etc., despite having identical images.
