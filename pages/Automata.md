# 📝Definition
- Automata theory deals with the definitions and properties of **mathematical models of computation**.
- An automaton is a mathematical model of a computing device. It’s an **abstraction** of a real computer, the way that graphs are abstractions of social networks, transportation grids, etc.

# 🎯Intent
- Automata theory allows practice with formal definitions of computation as it introduces concepts relevant to other nontheoretical areas of computer science.

# 🧠Intuition
- Automata is a **bridge**🌉 between
    - Theory of Computer Science
    - and Practice of Computer Science.
    
- Example of two kinds of automata - Calculator vs. Computer
    - Calculator
        - ![name](../assets/calculator.svg){:height 50, :width 50}
        - A calculator has a **small amount of memory**.
        - A calculator performs a **fixed set** of functions.
        
    - Computer
        - ![name](../assets/computer.svg){:height 50, :width 50}
        - A desktop computer has a **large amount of memory**.
        - A desktop is **reprogrammable** and can run many different programs.
