# 📝Definition
- A real function is said to be differentiable at a point if its [[derivative]] exists at that point. The notion of differentiability can also be extended to complex functions (leading to the Cauchy-Riemann equations and the theory of holomorphic functions), although a few additional subtleties arise in complex differentiability that are not present in the real case.

    - The following is true.
        - ✅function is differentiable at $x=a$, and therefore 👉 function is continuous at $x=a$
        
    - The following is wrong.
