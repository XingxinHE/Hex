alias:: differentiability

- # 🍴Quick Digest -> Differentiable
	- ## 📝Definition
	  A real function is said to be differentiable at a point if its [[derivative]] exists at that point. The notion of differentiability can also be extended to complex functions (leading to the Cauchy-Riemann equations and the theory of holomorphic functions), although a few additional subtleties arise in complex differentiability that are not present in the real case.
	- ## 🧠Intuition
	  Exist a derivative at that point.
	- ## 🧬Related Elements
		- 📌Relationship: Differentiable vs. [[Continuous]]
			- The following is true.
				- ✅function is differentiable at $x=a$, and therefore 👉 function is continuous at $x=a$
			- The following is wrong.
				- ❌function is continuous at $x=a$, and therefore 👉 function is differentiable at $x=a$
			- Graph
				- Look at the function $f(x)=|x|$
					- at $x=0$ continuous ✅
					- at $x=0$ differentiable ❌
