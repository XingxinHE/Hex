alias:: differentiability

- ## 📝Definition
	- A real function is said to be differentiable at a point if its [[derivative]] exists at that point. The notion of differentiability can also be extended to complex functions (leading to the Cauchy-Riemann equations and the theory of holomorphic functions), although a few additional subtleties arise in complex differentiability that are not present in the real case.

		- The following is true.
			- ✅function is differentiable at $x=a$, and therefore 👉 function is continuous at $x=a$
		- The following is wrong.
			- ❌function is continuous at $x=a$, and therefore 👉 function is differentiable at $x=a$

			- Look at the function $f(x)=|x|$
				- at $x=0$ continuous ✅
				- at $x=0$ differentiable ❌
