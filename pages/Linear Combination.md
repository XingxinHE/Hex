- ## 📝Definition
	- A sum of the elements from some set with constant coefficients placed in front of each.
- ## 🧠Intuition  
  Find an intuitive way of understanding this concept.
- ## 🧮Notation
	- We denote as the following
		- scalar as $\beta_1,\cdots,\beta_n$ ,(also called the coefficients of the linear combination)
		- vector as $a_1,\cdots,a_n$
	- Then the expression of linear combination is.
		- $$
		  \beta_1\alpha_1+\cdots+\beta_n\alpha_n
		  $$
- ## 💫Support Operation
  There are several special linear combination taking advantage of its nature.
	- 📌Use linear combination as Sum
		- when $\beta_1=\cdots=\beta_n=1$
	- 📌Use linear combination as Mean
		- when $\beta_1=\cdots=\beta_n=\frac{1}{n}$
	- 📌Affine combination
		- when $\beta_1+\cdots+\beta_n=1$
	- 📌convex combination / mixture / weighted average
		- when $\beta_1+\cdots+\beta_n=0$
- ## 🗃Example
  Example is the most straightforward way to understand a mathematical concept.
	- 📌Line and Segment
		- Use $c$ to represent a point on a line formed by $a,b$. Where $\theta$ is a scalar $0\leq\theta\leq1$
		  $$
		  c = (1-\theta)a+\theta b
		  $$
