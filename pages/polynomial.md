# 📝Definition
Polynomials are functions $P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dotsb + a_1 x + a_0$ 
where
- the constants $a_i$ are real numbers
- the powers $n$ are non-negative, finite integers

# ✒Notation
$$
\begin{align}
x^n
\end{align}
$$
- The mathematical way to write a general polynomial of [[#^bbcb5829b989f491|degree]] $n$ is
    - $$
      p(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x^{1}+a_{0}x^{0}.
      $$

# 🌈Properties

## 🔴Degree
**📝Definition**
The **highest** number $n$ such that $x^n$ has a **nonzero coefficient** is called the degree of polynomial.

**🏷Categories**
The following names are assigned to polynomials according to their degree
Special case – zero (see Degree of the zero polynomial below)
- Degree 0 – non-zero constant
- Degree 1 – linear
- Degree 2 – quadratic
- Degree 3 – cubic
- Degree 4 – quartic (or, if all terms have even degree, biquadratic)
- Degree 5 – quintic
- Degree 6 – sextic (or, less commonly, hexic)
- Degree 7 – septic (or, less commonly, heptic)
- Degree 8 – octic
- Degree 9 – nonic
- Degree 10 – decic


## 🟠Leading coefficient
**📝Definition**
The coefficient of the highest-degree terms.

**🗃Example**
$5$ is the leading coefficient of the following equation.
$$
f(x)=5x^4-4x^3+10
$$
