# 📝Definition
- Polynomials are functions built on nonnegative integer powers of $x$.

# ✒Notation
$$
\begin{align}
x^n
\end{align}
$$
- The mathematical way to write a general polynomial of [[#^bbcb5829b989f491|degree]] $n$ is
    - $$
      p(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x^{1}+a_{0}x^{0}.
      $$

    - The edges matter only due to [[#^bbcb5829b989f491|degree]] and [[#^767171017b03f419|leading coefficient]].

    - The wiggles in the center of these diagrams aren’t relevant—they depend on the other terms of the polynomial. The diagram is just supposed to show what the graphs look *like* near the left and right.

# ⛈Characteristics / Properties
- 📌Degree ^bbcb5829b989f491
    - The **highest** number $n$ such that $x^n$ has a **nonzero coefficient** is called the degree of polynomial.
    
- 📌Leading coefficient ^767171017b03f419
    - The coefficient of the highest-degree terms.
    - e.g. $5$ is the leading coefficient of the following equation.
        - $$
          f(x)=5x^4-4x^3+10
          $$
