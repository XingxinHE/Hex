- # üìùDefinition
	- The input is a sequence of pairs of integers, where each integer represents an object of some type and we are to interpret the pair $p$ $q$ as meaning $p$ is connected to $q$. We assume that "is connected to" is an [equivalence relation](((6328174b-a107-46d4-9c92-ed9b65e70b0f))).
- # üéØIntent
	- Our goal is to write a program to filter out extraneous pairs from the sequence: When the program reads a pair $p$ $q$ from the input, it should write the pair to the output only if the pairs it has seen to that point do not imply that $p$ is connected to $q$. If the previous pairs do imply that $p$ is connected to $q$, then the program should ignore the pair $p$ $q$ and proceed to read in the next pair.

		- Conclusion
		  collapsed:: true
			- In the end, you will find the very interesting fact that **with same interface, different algorithm and data structure scale the performance**!!
	- ## üìåBase Class
		- Since there are many repeated codes. I made a base class for different algorithms and data structures. I think this is a good example of [[Object-oriented Programming Paradigm]] as well.
		- ``` java
		  public abstract class UnionFindBase {
		      protected int[] id;        // the id has diff meaning in diff contexts
		      protected int amount;      // the amount of components
		      private int length;        // the length of elements
		  
		      protected UnionFindBase() {
		      }
		  
		      public void construct(int n) {
		          if (n < 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException();
		          amount = length = n;
		          id = new int[n];
		          for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
		              id[i] = i;
		          }
		      }
		  
		      public int length() {
		          return length;
		      }
		  
		      public boolean connected(int p, int q) {
		          return find(p) == find(q);
		      }
		  
		      public abstract void union(int p, int q); //üëà‚≠êunion function to override
		  
		      public abstract int find(int p); //üëà‚≠êfind function to override
		  }
		  
		  ```
	- ## üìåQuick Find
		- Data structure.
			- Integer array `id[]` of length $N$.
			- ‚≠êInterpretation: `id` stands for the "id of component". a.k.a. $p$ and $q$ are connected if and only if they have the same `id`.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1663854114441_0.png)
		- Operation
			- Find.
				- That is very easy to check if $p$ and $q$ have the same `id`.
				- e.g. `id[6] = 0; id[1] = 1;` 6 and 1 are not connected since they have different `id`.
			- Union
				- Union is very heavy which has to find all the related `id` need to change. That is iterating to change all entries whose `id` equals `id[p]` to `id[q]`.
				- e.g. If you want to union 6 and 1
				  ![image.png](../assets/image_1663854259793_0.png)
		- Cost model
			- | algorithm  | initialize | union | find |
			  | ---------- | ---------- | ----- | ---- |
			  | quick-find | $N$        | $N$   | 1    |
			- Union is too expensive. It takes $N^2$([quadratic](((6326888e-2beb-4ec0-bca1-0ba863acc203)))) array accesses to process a sequence of $N$ union commands on $N$ objects.
		- Code
			- ``` java
			  
			  public class QuickFind extends UnionFindBase {
			  
			      public QuickFind() {
			          super();
			      }
			  
			      public int find(int p) {
			          return id[p];
			      }
			  
			      public void union(int p, int q) {
			          int pId = find(p);
			          int qId = find(q);
			          if (pId == qId) {
			              return;
			          }
			          for (int i = 0; i < length(); i++) {
			              if (id[i] == pId) {
			                  id[i] = qId;
			              }
			          }
			          amount--;
			      }
			  }
			  
			  ```
	- ## üìåQuick Union
		- Data Structure
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1663854852541_0.png)
			- Integer array `id[]` of length $N$.
			- ‚≠êInterpretation: `id[i]` is parent of `i`.
				- e.g. Root of `i` is `id[id[id[...id[i]...]]]`.
			- Explanation
				- If I want to find
					- find `3`->`4`->`9`  (`9` itself is `9`. Stop)
					- find `2`->`9` (`9` itself is `9`. Stop)
				- Then we have the conclusion is that `3` and `2` are connected.
				- A better visualization
				  ![image.png](../assets/image_1663854817327_0.png)
		- Operation
			- Find
				- Not so hard, just a loop till the end. Check if $p$ and $q$ have the same root.
			- Union
				- Relative easy. To merge components containing $p$ and $q$, set the id of $p$'s root to the id of $q$'s root.
		- Cost Model
			- | algorithm   | initialize | union | find |
			  | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | ---- |
			  | quick-union | $N$        | 1     | $N$  |
			- The find operation can lead to worst case which is that the branch is too tall...
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1663855341003_0.png)
		- Code
			- ``` java
			  public class QuickUnion extends UnionFindBase {
			  
			      public QuickUnion() {
			      }
			  
			      public int find(int p) {
			          while (p != id[p]) p = id[p];
			          return p;
			      }
			  
			      public void union(int p, int q) {
			          int pRoot = find(p);
			          int qRoot = find(q);
			          if (pRoot == qRoot) {
			              return;
			          } else {
			              id[pRoot] = qRoot;
			              amount--;
			          }
			      }
			  
			  }

	- ## üìåWeighted Union
		- Intro
			- Weighted union is a refined version of quick-union.
		- Characteristics
			- Keep **track of size** of each tree (number of objects).
			- **Balance** by linking root of smaller tree to root of larger tree.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1663855519239_0.png){:height 300, :width 300}
		- Data Structure
			- Same as quick-union, but maintain extra array `size[i]` to count number of objects in the tree rooted at `i`.
		- Operation
			- Find
				- Identical to quick union.
			- Union
				- Modify quick-union to:
					- Link root of smaller tree to root of larger tree.
					- Update the `size[]` array.
		- Cost Model
			- Proposition. Depth of any node $x$ is at most $\lg N$. You can prove it if you want.

			      }
			  
			      public void union(int p, int q) {
			          int pRoot = find(p);
			          int qRoot = find(q);
			          if (pRoot == qRoot) return;
			          if (size[pRoot] < size[qRoot]) { id[pRoot] = qRoot; size[qRoot] += size[pRoot]; }
			          else                           { id[qRoot] = pRoot; size[pRoot] += size[qRoot]; }

		- üéØIntent
			- üìåTo find the probability that the system percolates
				- In a famous scientific problem, researchers are interested in: if sites are independently set to be open with probability $p$?
				  collapsed:: true
					- When $p=0$, the system does not percolate
					- When $p=1$, the system percolates.
				- The graph below shows the likelihood whether a system is percolated.
				  collapsed:: true
					- ![name](../assets/likelihood_percolation.png){:height 400, :width 400}
				- The task is to write a computer program to estimate¬†$p$. When $N$ is large, theory guarantees a sharp threshold $p^*$.
				  collapsed:: true
					- $p > p^*$: almost certainly percolates.
					- $p < p^*$: almost certainly does not percolate.
