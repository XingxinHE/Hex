# 📝Definition
- A `delegate` is a <u>reference</u> to a method.

# 🎯Intent
- You need to <u>avoid introducing dependencies</u> that might restrict the use of your class. **Delegates** provide the ideal solution, which fully **decouple** the <u>application logic in your methods</u> from the <u>applications that invoke them</u>.
