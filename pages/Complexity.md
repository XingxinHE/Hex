# 📝Definition
- In theoretical computer science, the term `complexity` is to mean the number of flops of the best method to carry out the computation. It always is denoted as $O$.
- In general, complexity is a hard-to-precisely-define notion or measure of the difficulty of constructing a solution to a problem or of the solution itself. Sometimes complexity is used to (simply) mean an estimate of the number of [[operation]]s needed to execute an [[Algorithm]].

# 🎯Intent
- The central of Complexity Theory is to answer *What makes some problems computationally hard and others easy?*.

# 🌓Complement
- 📌Complexity and [[Computability]] ^e35fa855b56b930c
    - The theories of computability and complexity are closely related.
        - In complexity theory, the objective is to classify problems as easy ones and hard ones
        - In computability theory, the classification of problems is by those that are solvable and those that are not.
        
    - Computability theory introduces several of the concepts used in complexity theory.
    
# 🤳Applicability
- [[Cryptography]]
    - Complexity theory has pointed cryptographers in the direction of computationally hard problems around which they have designed revolutionary new codes.
