alias:: Complexity Theory

- # 📝Definition
	- In theoretical computer science, the term `complexity` is to mean the number of flops of the best method to carry out the computation. It always is denoted as $O$.
- # 🎯Intent
	- The central of Complexity Theory is to answer *What makes some problems computationally hard and others easy?*.
- # 🌓Complement
	- 📌Complexity and [[Computability]]
	  id:: 3bb74380-8fbf-479f-b41c-6f4a01d4361f
		- The theories of computability and complexity are closely related.
			- In complexity theory, the objective is to classify problems as easy ones and hard ones
			- In computability theory, the classification of problems is by those that are solvable and those that are not.
		- Computability theory introduces several of the concepts used in complexity theory.
- # 🤳Applicability
	- [[Cryptography]]
		- Complexity theory has pointed cryptographers in the direction of computationally hard problems around which they have designed revolutionary new codes.
