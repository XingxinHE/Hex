# 📝Definition
**📃Definition 1**
A harmonic function is a twice [[continuity|continuously]] [[differentiable]] function ${\displaystyle f:U\to \mathbb {R} ,}$ where $U$ is an open subset of $\mathbb {R} ^{n}$, that satisfies [[Laplace's equation]], that is,
$$
\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x_1^2} + \frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x_2^2} + \cdots + \frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x_n^2} = 0
$$
everywhere on $U$. This usually written as
$$
\nabla^2 f = 0 
$$
or
$$
{\displaystyle \Delta f=0}
$$
___
**📑Definition 2**
A harmonic function is any real function $u(x,y)$ with [[continuity|continuous]] second [[partial derivative]] which satisfies [[Laplace's equation]],
$$
\nabla ^2u(x,y)=0.
$$

# 🗃Example
Example is the most straightforward way to understand a mathematical concept.

# 🧀Applicability
Harmonic functions play a role in problems of heat conduction, fluid flow, and electric potential.

## 🥖electromagnetism
Potential functions are extremely useful, for example, in electromagnetism, where they reduce the study of a 3-component vector field to a 1-component scalar function. A scalar harmonic function is called a scalar potential, and a vector harmonic function is called a vector potential.
