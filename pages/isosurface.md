# 📝Definition
An isosurface is a 3-D [[surface]] representation of points with **equal values** in a 3-D data distribution. The `isosurface` function computes and draws a surface by connecting points of a constant value within a volume of space.

# 🛠Analogy  
An isosurface is a three-dimensional analog of an [[isoline]].

# 🧠Intuition
It is a surface that represents points of a ==constant value== (e.g. *pressure*, *temperature*, *velocity*, *density*) within a volume of space.

> [!tip] Tip
> In other words, isosurface is a [[level set]] of a [[continuity|continuous]] function whose domain is 3-space.
