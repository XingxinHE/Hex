- # 📝Definition
	- The norm of a mathematical object is a quantity that in some (possibly abstract) sense **describes the size or extent of the object**.
- # 🏷(Sub)Categories
	- > Norms exist for several math domains.
	- complex numbers (the complex modulus, sometimes also called the complex norm or simply "the norm")
	- Gaussian integers (the same as the complex modulus, but sometimes unfortunately instead defined to be the absolute square)
	- quaternions (quaternion norm)
	- vector norms for [[vector]]
		- There are many "kinds" of vector norms... L-1, L-2, L-3, ...., L-infinity norm...
		- The most commonly encountered vector norm (often simply called "the norm" of a vector, or sometimes the magnitude of a vector) is the [[L2-norm]].
	- [[matrix]] (matrix norms)
