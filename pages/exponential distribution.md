# 📝Definition
$$
p(t) = a e^{-a t}, \quad 0 \leq t < \infty\qquad \text{(and }p(t) = 0, \quad t<0\text{)},
$$
where
- $p(t)$ is an [[Exponential Function|exponential function]].
- the [[mean|expected value]] is $1/a$.

> [!NOTE] Note
> Note that $\int _0^{\infty } a e^{-a t} \,  dt =1$, so this is a [[probability density function|probability distribution]]. 


# 🎯Intent
The exponential distribution is used to compute the [[probability]] of a “waiting time" between events, such as the arrival of a bus, the decay of a radioactive particle, or the time between phone calls during business hours.
