- ðŸ“Œ**Essential elements in a program**
- all executable codes must be defined inside a method, and methods must be inside  `class`  and  `struct` .
- `Main`  is the entry of a program and must be  `static` .
- ðŸ“Œ **Using namespace**
  
  In short, it can prevent duplicated method or class names. For example
  
  ```
  Rhino.Geometry.Circle;
  CGM.Basics.Circle;
  ```
  
  âš  class library can be split into a number of assemblies!
