- ## 📝Definition
	- The term perimeter refers either to the curve constituting the boundary of a [[lamina]] or else to the length of this boundary. The perimeter of a [[circle]] is called the [[circumference]], although that term is used by some authors to refer to the perimeter of an arbitrary curved geometric figure.
- ## 🧮Expression
	- The perimeters of some common [[laminae]] are summarized in the table below. In the table, $e$ is the [[eccentricity]] of an [[ellipse]], $a$ is its semimajor axis, and $E(k)$ is a complete elliptic integral of the second kind.
	  | lamina    | perimeter |
	  | --------- | --------- |
	  | [[circle]]    | $2\pi r$  |
	  | [[ellipse]]   | $4aE(e)$  |
	  | [[rectangle]] | $2(a+b)$  |
	  | [[square]]    | $4a$      |
	  | [[triangle]]  | $a+b+c$   |
