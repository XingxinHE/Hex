alias:: just to the left, just to the right

- # 😎Quick Digest -> just to the left or right
	- ## 📝Definition
	  When we use the phrase “$f'(x)>0$ just to the left of $a$," we mean that there is some open interval $(a-c, a)$ of positive width $c$ on which $f'$ is positive. This interval does not have to be very big, as long as it has some size! Similarly, “$f'(x)>0$  just to the right of $a$" means that there is some open interval $(a, a+d)$ of positive width $d$ on which $f'$ is positive.
