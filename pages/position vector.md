# 📝Definition
A position vector is a Euclidean vector that represents the position of a point $P$ in space in relation to an arbitrary reference origin $O$.

> [!info] Remark
> The term "position vector" is used mostly in the fields of #DifferentialGeometry  , #mechanics and occasionally #VectorCalculus  .


# 🧠Intuition
Merely a point representing in vector format.

# ✒Notation
Usually it can be denoted as
- option 1:   $\mathbf{x}$
- option 2:   $\mathbf{r}$
- option 3:   $\mathbf{s}$
it corresponds to the straight [[line segment]] from $O$ to $P$. In other words, it is the displacement or translation that maps the origin to $P$:
$$
\begin{align}
{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} ={\overrightarrow {OP}}}
\end{align}
$$
