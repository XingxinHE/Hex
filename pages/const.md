# üìùDefinition and Classification
- Definition by Bjarne. The value of a `const` object is not known at [[compile-time]]. Its value will be initialized at [[run-time]] and cannot be changed after [[Initialization]].
- Definition by Dan Saks. A `const` object is non-modifiable in terms of:
    - write‚ùå
    - read‚úÖ
    
# üöÄBenefit
 Turn potential [[run-time]] error to [[compile-time]] error. Therefore it is good at designing [[interface]].

# ‚å®Sample Code
- Example on initialization
  
  ``` c++
  const int number;			//‚ùåERROR. missing init
  extern const int limit;		//‚úÖOK. This is declare not definition.
  const int level = 42;		//‚úÖOK. Explicitly initialize.
  ```
- Example on the characteristic of `const`
  ``` c++
  const int number = 123;
  
  int n = number;		//‚úÖOK to read
  number = 2 * n + 1; //‚ùåNO to write
  ```

# üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èRelated Elements
- üìåKey Difference between [[constexpr]] and `const` in C++
    - `const` => run-time
    - `constexpr` => compile-time
    
# ü§≥Applicability
 `const` often is used in passing arguments and returning values by pointers and references.

- Uses for `const`
    - In light of the ((63010392-4a98-433e-a3f2-171ce5f96c26)), the categories are:
    - 1. Symbolic Constants ^a96c8a55f4f5336d
    - 2. Immutable(never changing) data ^c731a392d08fda7
    - 3. prevent modifying a potentially modifiable operand ^bfe43db6f575f35a
- Comparison between `const` and [[constexpr]]
    - for ((630181b2-07c2-41c8-bf6e-1da74f2b8812)), `constexpr` is better in modern C++.
    - for ((630181b6-f3be-46eb-b61f-da9ae23c8662)), `constexpr` is better in Modern C++.
    - for ((630181b8-4ffc-4cb3-bdaa-60d1dcaf020d)), `const` is better.
- `const` and [[Initialization]]
    - C++ insists that you MUST initialize every `const` object.
- [[constexpr|Constant Expression]]
    - Ben Saks claimed that "The dimension in an array object definition must be integer constant expression". He provides the following code.
      
      ``` c++
      void foo(size_t n)
      {
        int x[n];  //‚ùåNO. dim must be constant.
        int y[17];	//‚úÖOK. dim is constant.
      }
      ```
      
      However, I can compile with the code.
