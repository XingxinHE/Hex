# 📝Definition
The characteristic function of a [[set]] is a [[Convex Function]] that indicates the membership (or non-membership) of a given element in that set.

# ✒Notation
Let $X$ be a set, and let $A$ be a subset of $X$. The characteristic function of $A$ is the function
$$
\chi_{A} : X \to \mathbb{R} \cup \{ + \infty \}
$$
taking values in the extended real number line defined by
$$
\chi _{{A}}(x):={\begin{cases}0,&x\in A;\\+\infty ,&x\not \in A.\end{cases}}
$$
