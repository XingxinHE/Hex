# 📝Definition
Disc integration, also known in [[definite integral|integral calculus]] as the disc method, is a method for calculating the volume of a solid of revolution of a solid-state material when integrating along an axis "parallel" to the axis of revolution.
# ✒Notation
$$
\begin{align}
dV = \pi y^2\, dx.
\end{align}
$$

# 🧠Intuition
The method of disks gives the differential volume element for a curve rotated about the $x$-axis.
