# 📝Definition
- A **data structure** is **a way to store a non-constant amount of data**, supporting a set of operations to interact with that data.

# 🎯Intent
The data structures determine **how to store data highly affect the runtime** of such a algorithm.
- Many data structures might support the same [[interface]], but could provide different performance for each operation.
- Many problems can be solved trivially by storing data in an appropriate choice of data structure.

- 📌Comparison between Data Structure and [[interface]] ^8a966e5bc270ebf
    - When you think of *data structure* and *interface*, please do combine them altogether!
    - | Data Structure | Interface |
      | ---- | ---- | ---- |
      | A way to store data with algorithms that support operations | A collection of supported operations |
      | a **representation**: **how** operations are supported | a **specification**: **what** operations are supported |
      | the solution! | the problem! |
