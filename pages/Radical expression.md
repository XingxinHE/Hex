# 📝Definition

The symbol $\sqrt[n]{x}$ used to indicate a root is called a ==radical==, or sometimes a ==surd==. The expression $\sqrt[n]{x}$ is therefore read "$x$ radical $n$," or "the $n$th root of $x$."

# 🧪Composition
There are ==3== important stuffs in a radical expression.
- vinculum - the horizonal line
- radicand - the quantity under the vinculum
- index - the quantity $n$ written to the left

\begin{align}
(1)&\sqrt[n]{x} = x^{\frac{1}{n}}\\
(2)&\sqrt[n]{xy} = \sqrt[n]{x}\sqrt[n]{y}\\
(3)&\sqrt[m]{\sqrt[n]{x}} = \sqrt[{mn}]{x}\\
(4)&\sqrt[n]{\frac{x}{y}} = \frac{\sqrt[n]{x}}{\sqrt[n]{y}}\\
(5)&\sqrt[n]{x^n} = x, \quad \text{if $n$ is odd}\\
(6)&\sqrt[n]{x^n} = |x|, \ \text{if $n$ is even}\\
\end{align}
