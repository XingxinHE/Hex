## The history of C++
	- **📌Days before C++**
		- People are using machine language which reflects the design of the hardware rather than the needs of programmers.
	- **📌Object-oriented paradigm**
		- Before it, it is **procedural paradigm** represented by C. C++ is built of C and shifts the paradigm.
